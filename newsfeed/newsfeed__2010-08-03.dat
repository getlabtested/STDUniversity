<BODY><![CDATA[<p>TUESDAY, Aug. 3 (HealthDay News) -- Men looking to attract the opposite sex may want to add red to their wardrobe, a new study finds.</p>

<p>Researchers found that women are more drawn to males wearing the color.</p>

<p>"We found that women view men in red as higher in status, more likely to make money and more likely to climb the social ladder," lead author Andrew Elliot, a professor of psychology at the University of Rochester, said in a university news release. "And it's this high-status judgment that leads to the attraction."</p>

<p>He and his colleagues asked 288 female and 25 males undergraduates to look at photos of a man in which his shirt was digitally colored either red or another color. Women said the red shirt made the man appear more powerful, attractive and sexually desirable. However, it didn't make him seem more likeable, kind or sociable.</p>

<p>The women had the same responses when looking at a man's photo that was framed by a border of either red or white.</p>

<p>The study included undergraduates in the United States, England, Germany and China, and the effect in women was consistent across cultures. But the women were unaware of the reaction.</p>

<p>The color of the photo border or the man's shirt had no effect on males.</p>

<p>In many societies worldwide, red has long been associated with the rich and powerful, as evidenced by rolling out the "red carpet" at high-profile events,  Elliot noted in the release. And in non-human primates, such as mandrills and gelada baboons, red is an indicator of male dominance and is expressed more intensely in alpha males. Females of these species are more likely to mate with alpha males.</p>

<p>"When women see red it triggers something deep and probably biologically engrained," Elliot said. "We say in our culture that men act like animals in the sexual realm. It looks like women may be acting like animals as well in the same sort of way."</p> 

<p>The study is published in the Aug. 2 issue of the <i>Journal of Experimental Psychology: General</i>.</p>

<HEADLINE><![CDATA[Patients With Hepatitis B May Face Greater Risk of  Blood Cancer]]></HEADLINE>

<BODY><![CDATA[<p>TUESDAY, Aug. 3 (HealthDay News) -- People with hepatitis B infection have about twice the risk of developing non-Hodgkin lymphoma, finds a new study.</p>

<p>Previous research has established that hepatitis C infection is linked with increased risk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), but only small studies have been conducted on hepatitis B and NHL.</p>

<p>It's believed that liver infection caused by hepatitis results in sustained immune system activation that may trigger lymphocytes (white blood cells that are part of the immune system) to develop DNA mutations that can lead to NHL.</p>

<p>This study, published online Aug. 4 in <i>The Lancet Oncology</i>, 
included people in South Korea, where hepatitis B (HBV) was endemic until 1995 when the country began vaccination of all newborns. However, HBV infection remains common in adults because of infections acquired in childhood.</p>

<p>The researchers analyzed data from the Korean Cancer Prevention Study and found that 53,045 -- or 9 percent -- of 603,585 participants tested positive for HBV at baseline. During 14 years of follow-up, NHL was diagnosed in 133 people with HBV infection and 905 people who were HBV-negative.</p>

<p>The incidence of NHL was 19.4 per 100,000 person-years among those with HBV infection and 12.3 in those who were HBV-negative.</p>

<p>The American and South Korean researchers also found that people with HBV infection were nearly four times more likely to develop a rare condition called malignant immunoproliferation, a collection of immune disorders related to NHL.</p>

<p>"In this large cohort study of health workers and their families in South Korea, we documented an excess risk of NHL in people infected with HBV ... Additional research is needed to clarify whether the association between HBV infection and NHL is causal," the researchers wrote in a news release from the journal publisher.</p>

<p>"For HCV-infected patients with low-grade NHL [especially marginal zone lymphomas], HCV treatment seems effective for hematological remission. Thus, we speculate that treatment directed at HBV in similar low-grade NHLs might lead to a clinical response and remove the need for chemotherapy. Further investigation in appropriate clinical series will be important," they concluded.</p>
