<p>TUESDAY, June 15 (HealthDay News) -- Obesity is tied to reduced sexual activity and poorer sexual health, according to new research from France.</p>

<p>The rate of unplanned pregnancy among obese women is four times that of normal-weight women, despite the former having fewer partners, the report found.</p>

<p>For men, being obese greatly raised the odds for impotence and their risk of contracting a sexually transmitted disease.</p>

<p>"Being obese has a strong influence on people's sexual life," said lead researcher Nathalie Bajos, an associate professor at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and research director at the National Institute of Health and Medical Research, in Paris.</p>

<p>She believes obesity affects the sex lives of women particularly hard.</p>

<p>"Because of social pressure or social stigmatization, obese women are less likely to engage in sexual intercourse and more likely to find sexual partners via the Internet," Bajos said. "Because of their obesity, they are not comfortable meeting men through friends, through work, through parties," she reasoned.</p>

<p>Obese women are also more likely than thinner women to be in a relationship with a partner who is also obese or overweight, Bajos said.</p>

<p>A lot of these problems are driven by the stigmatization of obese women, she said, and "these women are more likely to have low self-esteem."</p>

<p>The report is published in the June 16 online edition of the <i>BMJ</i>.</p> 

<p>For the study, Bajos and colleagues collected data on the sexual behavior of more than 12,000 French men and women. Among this group, 3,651 women and 2,725 men were normal weight, 1,010 women and 1,488 men were overweight, and 411 women and 350 men were obese.</p>

<p>Putting on excess pounds did take a toll on sex lives, the study found.</p>

<p>Compared with normal-weight women and men, obese women were 30 percent less likely to have had a sex partner in the past year, while obese men were 70 percent less likely to have had more than one sex partner over the same time, the researchers found.</p>

<p>Obese men were also 2.5 times more likely to experience erectile dysfunction than normal-weight men, and obese men under 30 were more likely to have had a sexually transmitted disease, the researchers found.</p>

<p>Obese women under 30 often didn't seek contraceptive advice or use oral contraceptives, and were more likely to have an unintended pregnancy, the researchers found, and they were also less likely to visit a gynecologist, Bajos said. Due to being overweight, "they do not [always] feel comfortable seeing a gynecologist for contraception issues," she said.</p>

<p>In addition, gynecologists and general practitioners are less likely to prescribe contraception to obese women, Bajos noted. "It could be that they believe these women are less likely to have a sexual life," she said.  </p>

<p>The study also found that obese women were five times more likely to meet sex partners on the Internet and more likely to watch pornography. Yet they were less likely to view sex as important in their lives, Bajos said. </p>

<p>Dr. Sandy Goldbeck-Wood is associate specialist in psychosexual medicine at Camden and Islington Mental Health Trust in the U.K., and author of an accompanying editorial. She said that "the differing sexual experiences of obese and non-obese people need cautious interpretation."</p>
 
<p>"We need to understand more about how obese people feel about their sex lives, and what drives the observed behaviors and attitudes. In particular, we need to know why obese women use less contraception and have more unwanted pregnancies despite having fewer sexual partners," Goldbeck-Wood said. "The answers are likely to be complex, with biological, psychological and social aspects that will require a qualitative research approach," she added.</p>

<p>Doctors must also develop the courage, skill and sensitivity to speak to patients directly about their sex lives and their weight, Goldbeck-Wood noted. "Doctors in primary care and sexual and reproductive health need to pay particular attention to the complex contraceptive needs of obese women," she suggested.</p>

<p>Dr. Robert Schwartz, professor and chairman of family medicine at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine agreed that, right now, "a lot of physicians don't pay much attention to obese patients' sexuality."</p>

<p>His advice to doctors: "Don't make the assumption that your obese patients are not as sexually active as the rest of the population, and they need to be counseled appropriately." </p>

<HEADLINE><![CDATA[Gene Therapy for HIV Inches Forward]]></HEADLINE>
<BLURB><![CDATA[Viable treatment is still a long way off, researchers say]]></BLURB>
<BYLINE><![CDATA[<b>By Randy Dotinga</b><br><i>HealthDay Reporter</i>]]></BYLINE>
<BODY><![CDATA[<p>WEDNESDAY, June 16 (HealthDay News) -- Researchers report they've moved a step closer to treating HIV patients with gene therapy that could potentially one day keep the AIDS-causing virus at bay.</p>

<p>The study, published in the June 16 issue of the journal <i>Science Translational Medicine</i>, only looked at one step of the gene therapy process, and there's no guarantee that genetically manipulating a patient's own cells will succeed or work better than existing drug therapies. </p>

<p>Still, "we demonstrated that we could make this happen," said study lead author David L. DiGiusto, a biologist and immunologist at City of Hope, a hospital and research center in Duarte, Calif. And the research took place in people, not in test tubes.</p>

<p>Scientists are considering gene therapy as a treatment for a variety of diseases, including cancer. One approach involves inserting engineered genes into the body to change its response to illness. </p>

<p>In the new study, researchers genetically manipulated blood cells to resist HIV and inserted them into four HIV-positive patients who had lymphoma, a blood cancer. </p>

<p>The patients' healthy blood cells had been stored earlier and were being transplanted to treat the lymphoma.</p>

<p> Ideally, the cells would multiply and fight off HIV infection. In that case, "the virus has nowhere to grow, no way to expand in the patient," DiGiusto said.</p>

<p>At this early point in the research process, however, the goal was to see if the implanted cells would survive. They did, remaining in the bloodstreams of the subjects for two years.</p>

<p>In the next phases of research, scientists will try to implant enough genetically engineered cells to actually boost the body's ability to fight off HIV, DiGiusto said. </p>

<p>Plenty of caveats still exist. The research, as DiGiusto said, is experimental. And there's the matter of cost: He estimated that the price for gene therapy treatment for HIV patients could run about as much as a bone marrow transplant. Those cost about $100,000. </p>

<p>On the other hand, gene therapy has the potential to free HIV patients from a lifetime of taking medications that may fail to work, especially if the virus develops immunity to them, said David V. Schaffer, co-director of the Berkeley Stem Cell Center at the University of California at Berkeley and  co-author of a commentary accompanying DiGiusto's study.</p>

<p>Over time, the savings on medications could outweigh the cost of the gene therapy, he noted.</p>

<p>The treatment wouldn't necessarily be a cure because the virus would remain in the body. Still, it could create a situation "where HIV is present but at levels that are too low to detect and don't cause AIDS," Schaffer said.</p>

<HEADLINE><![CDATA[Antiretrovirals During Breast-Feeding Shield Babies From HIV, Study Shows]]></HEADLINE>
<BLURB><![CDATA[In sub-Saharan Africa, many avoid formula due to unsanitary water, expense, experts note]]></BLURB>
<BYLINE><![CDATA[<b>By Jenifer Goodwin</b><br><i>HealthDay Reporter</i>]]></BYLINE>
<BODY><![CDATA[<p>WEDNESDAY, June 16 (HealthDay News) -- In sub-Saharan Africa, many mothers with HIV are faced with an awful choice: breast-feed their babies and risk infecting them or use formula, which is often out of reach because of cost or can sicken the baby due to a lack of clean drinking water.</p>
 
<p>Now, two new studies find that giving pregnant and nursing women triple antiretroviral drug therapy, or treating breast-fed infants with an antiretroviral medication, can dramatically cut transmission rates, enabling moms to both breast-feed and to protect nearly all children from infection.</p>

<p>In one study, a combination antiretroviral drug therapy given to pregnant and breast-feeding women in Botswana kept all but 1 percent of babies from contracting the infection during six months of breast-feeding.</p> 

<p>Without the drug therapy, about 25 percent of babies would become infected with the AIDS-causing virus, according to researchers from the Harvard School of Public Health.</p>
 
<p>A second study, led by researchers from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, found that giving babies an antiretroviral drug once a day during their first six months of life reduced the transmission rate to 1.7 percent.</p>

<p>Both studies are published in the June 17 issue of the <i>New England Journal of Medicine</i>.</p>

<p>In the United States, HIV-positive women are typically given antiretrovirals during pregnancy to avoid passing HIV to their babies in utero or during labor and delivery. After the baby is born, women are advised to use formula instead of breast-feeding for the same reason, said senior study author Dr. Charles M. van der Horst, a professor of medicine and infectious diseases at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.</p>

<p>That works well in developed nations where formula is easy to come by and a clean water supply is readily available, van der Horst said.</p>

<p>But throughout much of sub-Saharan Africa, water supplies can be contaminated by bacteria and other pathogens that, especially in the absence of good medical care, can cause diarrheal illnesses that can be deadly for babies.</p>

<p>Previous research has shown that formula-fed babies in the region die at a high rate from pneumonia or diarrheal disease, leaving women in a Catch-22.</p>

<p>"In Africa, breast milk is absolutely essential for the first six months of life," van der Horst said. "Mothers there know that. It was a 'between a rock and a hard place' issue for them."</p>

<p>In the Botswana study, Harvard researchers gave 730 HIV-infected pregnant women one of three combinations of antiretroviral drugs starting between 26 weeks and 34 weeks gestation and continuing through six months after the baby's birth, at which point they would wean the child. Infants also received a single dose of nevirapine and four weeks of another antiretroviral medication.</p>

<p>Among those babies, the rate of mother-to-child transmission was 1.1 percent, the lowest ever reported, according to the study. The three versions of drug combinations had similar efficacy.</p>  

<p>In the study conducted in Malawi, HIV-positive mothers were given either antiretrovirals after delivery and while breast-feeding, or instructed to give their babies a single vial of the drug nevirapine daily. Infants in a third control group received a single dose of nevirapine and seven days of two other antiretroviral drugs.</p>

<p>About 5.7 percent of babies in the control group and 2.9 percent of babies whose mothers took the triple-drug therapy became infected with HIV by 6 months. The 2.9 percent figure could probably be lowered by starting the drug cocktail during pregnancy, van der Horst said.</p>
 
<p>Yet van der Horst believes for the poorest of the poor in Africa, the infant regimen is more feasible than triple-drug therapy for moms, which requires testing and monitoring and medical facilities to do so.</p>

<p>For infants, nevirapine is widely available and inexpensive relative to other drugs, and the once-a-day dosage is easy to carry out, he said.</p>

<p>"We found the infant nevirapine was incredibly safe, incredibly cheap, well-tolerated and it works incredibly well, almost completely shutting off transmissions immediately," van der Horst said.</p>
 
<p>Dr. Rodney Wright, director of HIV programs in the department of obstetrics and gynecology at Montefiore Medical Center in New York City, called the findings "very encouraging." The studies show rates of mother-to-child transmission comparable to those in the developed world.</p>

<p>"The studies show women in the developing world can have low levels of transmission of HIV from mother to child, even in the setting of breast-feeding," Wright said. "One of the big issues has always been the dilemma to choose between healthy breast-feeding, which carries with it the risk of HIV transmission, and issues of poor water supplies."</p>

<p>Researchers don't know why a small number of babies continue to get infected with HIV, but it could be due to a variety of reasons, including missed dosages or other infections that could prevent the medications from being absorbed properly.</p> 

<p>About 430,000 children are infected with HIV worldwide each year, about 40 percent of whom are infected through breast-feeding, according to an accompanying editorial.</p>
