<BODY><![CDATA[<p>WEDNESDAY, Dec. 1 (HealthDay News) - A physician with experience caring for armed forces personnel says the U.S. military's "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" policy puts both service members and the general public at risk by encouraging secrecy about sexual health issues.</p>

<p>"Infections go undiagnosed. Service members and their partners go untreated," Dr. Kenneth Katz, a physician at San Diego State University and the University of California at San Diego, wrote in a commentary published Dec. 1 in the <i>New England Journal of Medicine</i>. </p>

<p>And civilians "pay a price" because they have sex with service members who miss out on programs aimed at preventing the spread of the HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, as well as other sexually transmitted diseases, Katz wrote.</p>

<p>The military is currently pondering the end of the "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" policy, which does not allow gay service members to serve openly. No one knows how many gays are in the armed forces. However, one 2002 study found that active-duty Navy sailors made up 9 percent of the patients who visited one gay men's health clinic in San Diego.</p>

<p>Katz writes that he treated one active-duty gay member of the military who visited a sexually transmitted disease clinic in San Diego and was diagnosed with gonorrhea. Even though the military covered the man's medical expenses, he feared his career would be jeopardized if he went to a military doctor over issues of sexual health. </p>

<p>The U.S. military has said it will no longer use confidential medical information in its efforts to ferret out gay service members. But Katz writes that service members have told him that they haven't heard about  such a change. </p>

<p>In an interview, a psychologist who studies sexual orientation issues said that Katz "may be underselling the risks" posed to service members who must keep their personal lives private in order to avoid losing their jobs. </p>

<p>Research has shown that the act of inhibiting oneself is unhealthy, according to David Huebner, an assistant professor of psychology at the University of Utah. </p>

<p>On the other hand, he said, "if you disclose things that are personally difficult to you in a constructive way, your physical health can improve."</p>

<p>Physicians often deal with mental health issues,  Heubner added, and they'll be hobbled if service members aren't open about themselves. </p>

<p>THURSDAY, Dec. 2 (HealthDay News) -- You're likely looking forward to spending plenty of time with family and friends over the holidays, but you should take steps to ensure you and everyone else avoids getting the flu, advises an expert at Ryerson University in Toronto.</p>

<p>Here are some tips:</p><ul>
<li>Use air kisses instead of the real thing.</li>
<li>Wash your hands often and carry hand sanitizer with you.</li>
<li>Don't use your fingers when eating food at parties. Use serving spoons or forks. As a party host, make sure there are plenty of serving utensils.</li>
<li>Cough or sneeze into your sleeve in order to avoid spreading germs to people around you.</li>
<li>If you are at a religious service, try to keep your distance (three to six feet) from other people and don't share the wine goblet. Instead of shaking hands or hugging, greet others with a wave or an elbow greeting.</li>
<li>Make sure you get enough sleep in order to keep your immune system strong.</li>
<li>If you are sick, stay home.</li></ul>

<HEADLINE><![CDATA[Worldwide HIV-Prevention Services Lacking, Survey Finds]]></HEADLINE>

<BODY><![CDATA[<!--Spanish ID: 646893 -->
<p>THURSDAY, Dec. 2 (HealthDay News) -- The majority of gay men worldwide don't have access to HIV testing, counseling or free condoms and lubricant, a new study finds.</p>

<p>Researchers conducted an online survey of nearly 5,000 men who have sex with men (MSM) and MSM service providers. Nearly three-quarters of all participants were from low- or middle-income countries.</p>

<p>Only 39 percent of respondents said they have easy access to free condoms and only about 25 percent said they have easy access to free lubricant, while another 25 percent said free lubricant was unavailable. The survey also found that access to other essential services was difficult or impossible, including HIV testing (57 percent), HIV education materials (66 percent) and HIV treatment (70 percent).</p>

<p>Findings of the survey, which was conducted in Chinese, English, French, Russian and Spanish, were released Dec. 1 to coincide with World AIDS Day. The poll was conducted by the Global Forum on MSM &amp; HIV.</p>

<p>"Since the beginning of the epidemic, it has been widely recognized that condoms, lubricant, testing and treatment, when combined with community-led behavior change and support programs, are the most reliable tools available in the fight against HIV among MSM," Dr. George Ayala, executive officer of the Global Forum on MSM &amp; HIV, said in an organization news release.</p>

<p>"More than 25 years in, it is inexcusable that MSM around the world continue to have such restricted access to these basic lifesaving resources," he added.</p>
