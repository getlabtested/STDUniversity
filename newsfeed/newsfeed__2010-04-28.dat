<p>WEDNESDAY, April 28 (HealthDay News) -- Two proteins in a family of proteins called PLA2s play a vital role in sperm function and fertility in mice, say two teams of researchers.</p>

<p>The findings could improve understanding of male infertility and lead to new types of male birth control and treatments for infertility.</p>

<p>In one study, Japanese researchers found that the protein sPLA2-III is expressed in an area of the testis called the proximal epididymal epithelium. Male mice that lacked the protein had low levels of fertility because their sperm did not mature properly, which resulted in decreased motility and decreased ability to fertilize eggs.</p>

<p>In the second study, French researchers found that male mice that lacked the protein group X secreted PLA2 (also known as mGX) produced smaller litters than normal, and that sperm from mGX-deficient mice were not efficient at fertilizing eggs.</p>

<p>The studies were published April 26 in the <i>Journal of Clinical Investigation</i>.</p>

<HEADLINE><![CDATA[HPV Test Beats Pap Smear for Cancer Screening]]></HEADLINE>

<BODY><![CDATA[<!--Spanish ID: 638582 -->
<p>WEDNESDAY, April 28 (HealthDay News) -- Doctors can detect more serious precancerous lesions in the cervix by testing for human papillomavirus (HPV) than through conventional cervical screening with a Pap smear, a new study suggests.</p>

<p>HPV, a common sexually transmitted disease, can cause cancers such as cervical cancer. The disease is especially prevalent in young women.</p>

<p>In the new study, led by Ahti Anttila of the Finnish Cancer Registry, researchers studied the experiences of 58,282 women aged 30 to 60 who took part in routine cervical screening between 2003 and 2005.</p>

<p>The women were randomly assigned to receive an HPV test or a Pap smear test. The researchers then tracked the women for five years.</p>

<p>The HPV screening tests did a better job at detecting serious precancerous lesions on the surface of the cervix, known as cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN III), according to the report published online April 28 in the <i>BMJ</i>.</p>

<p>The researchers cautioned that they didn't detect very many cervical cancer cases. Still, they wrote, "considering the high probability of progression of CIN III lesions in women aged 35 years or more, our results are important for prevention of cervical cancer."</p>

<HEADLINE><![CDATA[Chewing Khat Linked to Severe Liver Damage]]></HEADLINE>
<BLURB><![CDATA[Herb appears to lead to liver failure in some, British researchers say]]></BLURB>
<BYLINE><![CDATA[<b>By Steven Reinberg</b><br><i>HealthDay Reporter</i>]]></BYLINE>
<BODY><![CDATA[<p>WEDNESDAY, April 28 (HealthDay News) -- Chewing khat leaves for a mild high is popular in East Africa and the Arabian Peninsula, and the practice is also seen among certain immigrant groups in Great Britain and the United States.</p>

<p>But chewing khat can cause severe liver damage and even death, British researchers report.</p>

<p>Khat contains cathinone, an amphetamine-like stimulant that causes euphoria, excitement and loss of appetite. Although banned in the United States, it finds its way to North America from Britain, where it is readily available, the researchers reported in a letter to the editor in the April 29 issue of the <i>New England Journal of Medicine</i>.</p>

<p>Dr. Eugene Schiff, director of the Center for Liver Diseases at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine in Florida, said the danger posed by khat "is well established in the literature."</p>

<p>"We see this in a variety of herbal substances," he added.</p> 

<p>In their letter, Dr. Michael H. Chapman, of University College London Medical School, and his colleagues reported on six patients in Britain who had either died of liver failure or needed liver transplants. The common denominator and suspected cause was the chewing of khat leaves.</p>

<p>The patients were seen over five years and all had been cautioned about khat's risks. One of the patients died and five needed liver transplants, the researchers said.</p>

<p>Chapman's group found no other potential causes for liver damage. Five of the patients had a history of unexplained hepatitis.</p>

<p>Khat has also been linked to mental problems and heart disease, the researchers noted.</p>

<p>While it's not exactly known how khat damages the liver, Chapman's team speculates that it triggers low-level hepatitis, and repeated use leads to chronic liver disease.</p>

<p>Schiff said that when doctors see liver problems associated with a drug as widely used as khat, "it usually means that that particular person is metabolizing it differently, because otherwise you would see it in thousands of people."</p>

<p>Chapman's team thinks that doctors should consider khat as a cause of unexplained liver disease among patients from ethnic communities where khat chewing is common.</p>

<p>Schiff agreed that doctors should suspect khat as a cause of unexplained liver disease in appropriate patients. But, he added, even if you know the cause, patients with this degree of liver failure will still need a transplant.</p>

<p>"People who are doing this are taking it on their own and have no idea that it is toxic to the liver," Schiff said, adding that users need to be better informed about the risks. </p>
