<BODY><![CDATA[<p>MONDAY, June 21 (HealthDay News) -- Abbott's Architect HIV Ag/Ab Combo assay has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.</p>

<p>Traditional HIV diagnostics have detected HIV antibodies, which are developed days after an infection as a sign that the body is working to fight the invading virus. The Architect assay also detects the HIV p24 antigen, which is a protein produced by the virus immediately after infection, Abbott said in a news release.</p>

<p>The risk of HIV transmission is highest just after infection with the AIDS-causing virus, the company said.</p>

<p>Since the new test could detect HIV infection days earlier than antibody-only diagnostics, people could be alerted before unknowingly spreading the infection and be treated earlier, Abbott said.</p>

<p>Some 56,000 new cases of HIV infection are diagnosed each year in the United States, the Illinois-based company said, citing the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p>
