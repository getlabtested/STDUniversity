<BODY><![CDATA[<p>FRIDAY, July 23 (HealthDay News) -- Some HIV-positive women who want to have children feel stigmatized by their doctors, new research has found.</p>

<p>In the study, Canadian researchers surveyed 159 HIV-positive women in the province of Ontario. Forty-five percent of the women were born in Canada, while 55 percent were born elsewhere, mainly in HIV-endemic areas such as sub-Saharan Africa and the Caribbean.</p>

<p>The study participants were asked about their personal background, HIV treatments, mental health and whether they felt they were being negatively judged by health-care providers, family and friends for their desire to have children.</p>

<p>"We do have strong evidence that women are feeling they are being judged negatively by health-care providers for wanting to have babies," study co-author Trevor Hart, director of the HIV Prevention Lab in the psychology department at Ryerson University in Toronto, said in a university news release.</p>

<p>Family and friends didn't play a major role in perceived stigmatization, the study authors found.</p>

<p>The study findings, scheduled for presentation this week at the International AIDS Conference in Vienna, Austria, were also published in the June issue of the journal <i>Archives of Women's Mental Health</i>.</p>

<p>New antiretroviral drugs mean that HIV-positive women can conceive without transmitting HIV to their newborns, and health-care providers should know this and be informing patients, Hart explained in the news release.</p>

<p>"There needs to be more efforts to make physicians aware of the practically nil chance of HIV-positive women transmitting HIV to their newborns as long as the women are continuing to receive appropriate medical treatment," he stated.</p>

<p>"There also needs to be continuing medical education to reduce the stigma perceived by HIV-positive women, which will improve their mental health and well-being," Hart added.</p>
