<p>SUNDAY, July 18 (HealthDay News) - Effective and widespread treatment of HIV disease may also help cut the rate of new infections, researchers report.</p>

<p>Since the introduction of powerful anti-HIV drugs known as highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in 1996, the number of new cases of HIV infection in the Canadian province of British Columbia has decreased by more than half, the team report.</p>

<p>The study is published online July 18 in <i>The Lancet</i> in conjunction with its presentation Sunday at the International AIDS Society (IAS) meeting in Vienna.</p>

<p>"Our results show a strong and significant association between increased HAART coverage, reduce community viral load, and decreased number of new HIV diagnoses per year in the population of a Canadian province," Professor Julio Montaner, director of the British Columbia Centre for Excellence in HIV/AIDS, and his colleagues wrote in a news release issued by the journal.</p>

<p>HAART slows the progression of HIV/AIDS symptoms.</p>

<p>The team analyzed data from the British Columbia Centre for Disease Control and found that between 1996 and 2009, the number of people receiving HAART increased from 837 to 5,413 (547 percent increase) and the number of new HIV diagnoses fell from 702 to 338 per year (52 percent decrease).</p>

<p>For every 100 additional patients on HAART, the number of new HIV cases decreased by 3 percent. There was also a significant decrease in mean HIV viral load concentrations, a trend linked to the decrease in new HIV cases, the researchers said.</p>

<p>New HIV diagnoses fell by 30 percent between 1996 and 2000, declined 2 percent between 2001 and 2003, and fell another 17 percent between 2004 and 2009. Evolving treatment guidelines led to substantial increases in HAART use in 1996-2000 and 2004-09, the study found.</p>

<p>The largest decrease (nearly 50 percent) in new HIV cases between 1996 and 2009 was among injection drug users.</p>

<p>The researchers also found that rates of sexually transmitted diseases and hepatitis C infections increased during the last years of the study, which suggests that the decrease in new HIV cases can't be attributed to a decrease in risky sexual behaviors associated with HIV transmission.</p>

<p>"Our results support the proposed secondary benefit of HAART used within existing medical guidelines to reduce HIV transmission [and] provide a strong rationale for re-examination of the HIV prevention and treatment dichotomy, as has been strongly advocated by the UN Joint Program on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) as part of a comprehensive combination prevention strategy," the researchers concluded.</p>

<p>This study, as well as previous work by Montaner and his colleagues, have helped shape the new UNAIDS strategy that calls for 15 million HIV patients worldwide to be treated with antiretroviral drugs, instead of the current five million patients. The plan would cost $26 billion a year.</p>

<p>HIV/AIDS experts should take note of the Canadian researchers' study, two Italian doctors wrote in an accompanying editorial in the journal.</p> 

<p>"While waiting for an effective vaccine, experiences such as those reported today should be strongly considered by clinicians, national and international agencies, policy makers, and all parties involved in the development of treatment guidelines, because the population-based dimension of HAART might play an important part in the future control of the HIV epidemic," wrote Dr. Franco Maggiolo and Dr. Sebastiano Leone, Division of Infectious Diseases, Ospedali Riuniti in Bergamo.</p>

<HEADLINE><![CDATA[New Guidelines Urge Earlier Therapy for HIV Patients]]></HEADLINE>

<BYLINE><![CDATA[]]></BYLINE>
<BODY><![CDATA[<!--Spanish ID: 641284 -->
<p>SUNDAY, July 18 (HealthDay News) -- Starting antiretroviral treatment (ART) when an HIV patient has no symptoms can prevent the progressive immune system destruction that leads to AIDS, according to new treatment guidelines released by the International AIDS Society-USA Panel.</p>

<p>The 2010 recommendations were written by a panel of experts who reviewed new HIV data and research on timing of therapy, optimal regimen choices and monitoring that has emerged since the publication of the 2008 guidelines. There's also now more knowledge about the effectiveness, toxicity and potential uses of newer drugs in HIV management.</p>

<p>"The prominence of non-AIDS events as a major cause of morbidity and mortality in those with ongoing HIV replication suggests that early ART initiation may further improve the quality and length of life for persons living with HIV," the panel members wrote.</p>

<p>Patient readiness is a key consideration when doctors are deciding to prescribe ART and there is no CD4 cell count level that would prevent the initiation of therapy, they added.</p>

<p>CD4 cells are immune system cells targeted by HIV, so concentrations (counts) of CD4 in blood are a key indicator of disease progression.</p>

<p>According to the new guidelines:</p><ul>

<li>ART is recommended for patients without symptoms with CD4 cell counts at 500 cells or less per microliter.</li>
<li>ART should be considered for patients without symptoms with CD4 cell counts greater than 500 per microliter and is recommended regardless of CD4 cell counts for patient who have established HIV disease with symptoms.</li>
<li>ART is also recommended for patients who are pregnant, older than 60, or have an active or high risk for cardiovascular disease, and for those with hepatitis B or C infections, HIV-associated kidney disease, opportunistic diseases or symptomatic primary HIV infection.</li>
<li>ART should also be prescribed in cases where there is a high risk for HIV transmission, such as couples with one HIV-infected and one HIV-free partner.</li>
<li>Once started, ART should be continued, except when being used in a clinical trial.</li>
<li>Risk-reduction counseling should be a routine part of care.</li></ul>  

<p>The new guidelines are scheduled for presentation at the International AIDS Conference in Vienna on Sunday and will be published in the July 21 HIV/AIDS theme issue of the <i>Journal of the American Medical Association</i>.</p>

<p>"Far too many HIV-infected persons present for medical care with advanced disease, both in wealthy and resource-limited settings. Universal voluntary HIV testing, comprehensive prevention services, and early linkage to care and treatment are necessary to ensure that advances in ART are made available during earlier disease stages," the authors of the report wrote.</p>

<p>"Advances in ART have shown that AIDS, as traditionally defined, can be prevented. One of the greatest challenges is that full implementation of these guidelines will require addressing social and structural barriers to diagnosis and care, as well as the pervasive stigma and discrimination associated with an HIV diagnosis," they concluded.</p>

<HEADLINE><![CDATA[Many False-Positive HIV Test Results for Those in AIDS Vaccine Trials]]></HEADLINE>
<BLURB><![CDATA[Almost half get the erroneous result, causing stigma and hampering trial enrollment, experts say]]></BLURB>
<BYLINE><![CDATA[<b>By Amanda Gardner</b><br><i>HealthDay Reporter</i>]]></BYLINE>
<BODY><![CDATA[<!--Spanish ID: 641282 -->
<p>SUNDAY, July 18 (HealthDay News) -- Almost half of HIV-negative people who participate in clinical trials for HIV vaccines end up testing positive on routine HIV tests -- even though they're not actually infected, a new study shows.</p>

<p>The reason: They underwent what experts call "vaccine-induced seropositivity/reactivity" (VISP), meaning that they possess immune system antibodies to the virus but not the virus itself. That's an important distinction, since routine HIV screening looks for virus antibodies only.  </p>

<p>Experts pointed out that the results are not new or surprising, but simply underline the delicacies of conducting trials into HIV/AIDS. </p>

<p>"You need to make sure to use other forms of testing for HIV, for example, viral load or p24 antigen, not just HIV antibodies. And people who've been in trials need to know their antibody status by the end of the trial," said Dr. Michael Horberg, director of HIV/AIDS at Kaiser Permanente in Santa Clara, Calif. "If it is a false positive but they do not have HIV infection, that would be very important for them to know, especially if they do repeat testing as part of good preventive health."</p>

<p>But a positive test can still carry stigma as well as insurance repercussions, noted Dr. Jerome F. Levine, an infectious diseases specialist with Hackensack University Medical Center in New Jersey, adding that "trials have had trouble recruiting people for this very reason."</p>

<p>The findings are simultaneously being presented Sunday at the International AIDS Conference in Vienna and published in the July 21 issue of the <i>Journal of the American Medical Association</i> (<i>JAMA</i>). </p>

<p>In this study of almost 2,200 people -- all participants in HIV vaccine trials -- 41.7 percent underwent VISP and tested positive for HIV antibodies. And those rates differed depending on the type of vaccine administered, ranging from 6.3 percent to 86.7 percent. </p>

<p>A second study, also being presented at the conference and published in <i>JAMA</i>, found that a screening program used in emergency departments where patients can "opt out" did not turn up very many new cases of HIV. These types of screening programs routinely test people entering the emergency room, regardless of their suspected level of risk or the presence or absence of symptoms.</p>

<p>The study compared the effectiveness of the test in turning up new cases of HIV infection versus tests ordered directly by a doctor. </p>

<p>The "opt-out" program started being recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in 2006, but only in locales where the rate of undiagnosed cases of HIV infection rose above 0.1 percent. </p>

<p>Most health care facilities in the United States still don't use the opt-out method, said Levine. </p>

<p>This study took place in a Denver emergency department that annually sees about 55,000 patients. The hospital alternated from physician-directed testing to opt-out testing every four months over the course of two years. </p>

<p>First of all, the study found that only 25 percent of patients in the opt-out group actually agreed to a test.</p>

<p>Furthermore, close to 7,000 people were screened but only 0.15 percent turned out to be HIV-positive. Only 1 percent of the more than 21,000 patients who opted out were screened later and only 2.2 percent of those were found to be HIV-positive.  </p>

<p>The small number of people who underwent HIV testing -- only one-quarter -- is a big limitation to the study, said Horberg, but that doesn't mean that such programs don't have value. </p>

<p>"Just because someone has a negative test, that doesn't mean that that testing wasn't successful," he said. "It may have raised the awareness of the patient. It may be prompting them to change their behavior and to really do an analysis of what good preventive health they need to follow."</p>

<p>A third paper in the journal recommended that all cancer patients be screened for HIV. This might sway cancer treatment decisions, for instance, helping doctors and patients avoid drugs that suppress the immune system, the authors noted. </p>

<HEADLINE><![CDATA[Poverty Driving HIV's Spread Among Urban Heterosexuals: Report]]></HEADLINE>
<BLURB><![CDATA[Infection rates climb as income falls, regardless of race/ethnicity, CDC says]]></BLURB>
<BYLINE><![CDATA[<b>By Steven Reinberg</b><br><i>HealthDay Reporter</i>]]></BYLINE>
<BODY><![CDATA[<p>MONDAY, July 19 (HealthDay News) -- In the poorer neighborhoods of America's cities, about 1 in every 50 heterosexual adults are now infected with HIV -- a much higher rate than is seen in the general population, U.S. health officials report. </p>

<p>The finding suggests that poverty plays a crucial role in spread of the virus that causes AIDS, according to a team from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).</p>

<p>The link between low income and a higher risk of getting infected with HIV held regardless of race or ethnicity, the researchers found.</p>

<p>"This study shows that we can't look at HIV in isolation from the environment in which people live," Dr. Jonathan Mermin, director of CDC's Division of HIV/AIDS Prevention, said during a noon press conference held Monday.</p>

<p>"It also points to an urgent need to prioritize HIV prevention efforts in economically disadvantaged communities," he said.</p>

<p>The report is slated to be presented at the International AIDS Conference being held this week in Vienna, Austria.</p>

<p>The study shows there is a generalized HIV epidemic among the inner-city poor in the United States, Dr. Kevin Fenton, director of CDC's National Center for HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and TB Prevention, said during the press conference.</p>

<p>"We need to reach everyone in that defined community with HIV prevention information and intervention, not just those at highest risk," he said.</p>

<p>For the report, a team led by Dr. Paul Denning, a medical epidemiologist in CDC's Division of HIV/AIDS Prevention, collected data on more than 9,000 heterosexual adults living in poorer sections of 23 American cities. These people participated in the 2006-2007 heterosexual section of the CDC's National HIV Behavioral Surveillance System, which monitors HIV risk, testing and prevention services. </p>

<p>Overall, 2.1 percent of those surveyed were infected with HIV, the team found.</p>

<p>The rate of HIV infection was especially steep among the least well-off. For example, 2.4 percent of people living below the poverty line were infected with HIV versus 1.2 percent of those living above the poverty line, the team found.</p>

<p>Those rates are substantially higher than the national average of HIV infection, which is estimated at 0.45 percent of the population.</p>

<p>There were no significant differences in prevalence of HIV prevalence by race or ethnicity in low-income urban areas, the researchers add.  Prevalence was 2.1 percent for blacks, 2.1 percent for Hispanics and 1.7 percent for whites.</p>

<p>That's contrary to statistics for the United States as a whole, which show that HIV is characterized by wide racial and ethnic disparities. Among blacks, HIV rates are almost eight times higher than among whites and among Hispanics the rate is almost three times higher than whites, Denning's team noted.</p>

<p>"Poverty may account for some of the [nationwide] racial/ethnic disparity," Mermin noted.  But other factors linked to low income can also contribute to HIV, the researchers said. These include limited access to health care, which can reduce  the use of HIV testing and prevention services; drug abuse, which can increase risky sexual behavior; and high incarceration rates, which can adversely affect relationships.</p>

<p>During the press conference, Denning noted that rates of HIV infection among the inner-city poor was highest in cities in the Northeast and lowest in the West and Mid-West.</p>

<p>The report provides insight into factors that seem to be driving HIV transmission among heterosexuals, who account for 31 percent of new infections each year, the researchers say.</p>

<p>Each year more than 56,000 Americans become infected with HIV, Fenton said. "More than 1.1 million Americans are currently living with HIV and nearly 18,000 people AIDS still die each year in the United States," he said.</p>

<p>In the U.S., 53 percent of new HIV infections are among homosexual and bisexual men and 12 percent occur among injection drug users. An additional 4 percent of new cases are among men who have sex with men and use injection drugs, the researchers note.</p>

<HEADLINE><![CDATA[Vaginal Gel Cuts Risk of HIV Infection, Study Shows]]></HEADLINE>
<BLURB><![CDATA[When used consistently before and after sex, antiretroviral halved chances of transmission]]></BLURB>
<BYLINE><![CDATA[<b>By Amanda Gardner</b><br><i>HealthDay Reporter</i>]]></BYLINE>
<BODY><![CDATA[<p>MONDAY, July 19 (HealthDay News) -- A vaginal gel applied consistently before and after sex reduced the risk of HIV infection by more than half, according to a study presented Monday at the International AIDS Conference in Vienna.</p>

<p>The gel contains tenofovir (Viread), an antiretroviral drug used to treat HIV/AIDS.</p>

<p>"If this was implemented and women in the general population used it in the same way as we observed in the trial, it could avert 1.3 million infections over the next 20 years," said study co-author Dr. Salim S. Abdool Karim. The report also appears in the July 20 online issue of <i>Science</i>.</p>

<p>Despite these  promising results, the gel still needs to be further researched, licensed and approved and is not likely to be available to women at clinics any time within the next year or two, said Abdool Karim, who is director of the Centre for the AIDS Programme of Research in South Africa (CAPRISA) and pro vice-chancellor (research) at the University of KwaZulu-Natal in South Africa.</p>

<p>U.S. health officials quickly applauded the findings.</p>

<p>"The CAPRISA microbicide trial results are an exciting step forward for HIV prevention. While these findings may need to be confirmed by other research to meet requirements for licensure by [the U.S. Food and Drug Administration] and other regulatory bodies throughout the world, they suggest that we could soon have a new method to help reduce the heavy toll of HIV among women around the world," Dr. Kevin Fenton, director of the National Center for HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and TB Prevention at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said in a CDC statement.</p>
<p>"Women represent the majority of new HIV infections globally, and urgently need methods they can control to protect themselves from infection. It is also very encouraging that the study found that the microbicide significantly reduced the risk of genital herpes [HSV-2], which is common in developing countries and in the United States, and facilitates HIV transmission," Fenton added.</p>  

<p>Almost three-quarters of AIDS cases worldwide are in Africa, especially sub-Saharan Africa. Women represent about half of all HIV infections globally; young women are particularly at risk. </p>

<p>So far, trials of microbicides -- compounds to be applied to the vagina or rectum to prevent infection with sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) -- have been disappointing.</p>

<p>Eleven trials in the past 15 years have shown no change or even sometimes an increase in transmission rates, said study co-author Quarraisha Abdool Karim, associate director of CAPRISA and an associate professor of epidemiology at the Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health in New York City. </p>

<p>Quarraisha Abdool Karim and Salim S. Abdool Karim are married.</p>

<p>For this study, close to 900 HIV-negative women aged 18 to 40 in urban and rural KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, an epicenter of the AIDS epidemic, were randomized to take the Viread gel or a placebo gel. </p>

<p>Participants were told to administer two doses of the gel: one within 12 hours before sex and one within 12 hours after sex.</p>

<p>The trial lasted almost three years.</p>

<p>Overall, the gel reduced HIV infection by 39 percent. But in women who had high adherence (using the gel more than 80 percent of the time), the risk reduction was 54 percent, compared to women in the placebo group.</p>

<p>"Without this gel, for every 100 women we may see 10 women being infected in a year," said Salim S. Abdool Karim. "With this gel, we would see only six women being infected."</p>

<p>The gel also reduced the risk of contracting genital herpes by 51 percent, a factor which could slow the spread of HIV even further, given that people with genital herpes have double the risk of getting HIV, said Salim S. Abdool Karim.</p>

<p>The gel appeared to be less effective after 18 months. "We think the diminishing protection is largely due to diminished adherence," said Salim S. Abdool Karim, although this is not proven. </p>

<p>"I think one of the differences is that all the other products were surface-active. They needed to be on the surface of the vagina sufficiently available and sufficiently well-spread in order to prevent HIV infection," said Salim S. Abdool Karim. "Tenofovir is not surface-active. It goes into cells which HIV will be targeting so it acts at a different point in the pathogenesis process."</p>

<p>In their quest to get the gel on the market and widely used, the researchers will be enlisting the help of marketers.</p>

<p>"This is simply a cylindrical white plastic tube. You can't get anything more unattractive," said Salim S. Abdool Karim. "Even Coke would have gone bankrupt if they had adopted this approach to their marketing. We only made this gel for the study. I think the future is going to involve making this gel sexy, making this gel something that is part-and-parcel of the sex act, that enhances sex. Packaging is part-and-parcel of addressing the adherence issue."</p>
