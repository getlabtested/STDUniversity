<p>THURSDAY, Sept. 30 (HealthDay News) -- The cause of male infertility often escapes experts, but scientists have found a genetic mutation that appears to disrupt  sperm production.</p>

<p>"This may be the most frequent single gene defect that is associated with male infertility known to date, with 4 percent of men with unexplained severe spermatogenic failure carrying a mutation," said Kenneth McElreavey, a researcher at the Pasteur Institute in France and a member of the team that made the discovery.</p>

<p>The gene, NR5A1, has been associated with other reproductive problems, McElreavey noted. "Studies in the last 10 years have linked mutations involving NR5A1 to defects in the development of external genitalia in boys," he said. "Last year, we identified mutations in this gene associated with a range of reproductive problems in women."</p>

<p>The new study links mutations in the same gene with reduced sperm count, which can lead to male infertility problems.</p>

<p>Male infertility is believed to account for nearly half of all infertility cases. Worldwide, about one in seven couples has problems with infertility and conception, according to the study.</p>

<p>McElreavey and his colleagues reported the findings online Sept. 30 in the <i>American Journal of Human Genetics.</i></p>

<p>The researchers sequenced the gene in 315 healthy men who sought treatment for  infertility because of an unexplained failure to produce sperm. They found seven men with a severe sperm production problem who carried a mutation in the gene.  The defect was not found in more than 2,000 samples from a control group, for comparison.</p>

<p>The carriers of the mutation, McElreavey said, "may have a progressive reduction in sperm quality and quantity over time."  </p>

<p>However, some men may be affected more than others if the findings in women -- "some women carriers of the mutations have no obvious reproduction [defects]," he said -- also hold true in men. The difference may stem from other genetic or environmental factors, he explained.</p>

<p>In the future, McElreavey added, those identified as carriers might be counseled to start a family earlier rather than later, if suspicions about the progressive nature of the defect bear out.</p>

<p>What's not known is whether other genes regulated by NR5A1 are also contributing to sperm production problems, he said.</p>

<p>Dr. Robert Oates, a urology professor at Boston University School of Medicine, described the study as scientifically very sound but offered some caveats.</p>

<p>The researchers found a link, but not cause and effect, he pointed out.  And, the finding has no immediate practical application. "There's no commercial test for this [mutation] at this point," Oates said.</p>

<p>As good as the science is, Oates noted, the finding must be duplicated by other experts, in scientific fashion. </p>

<p>For now, he said, the finding might help convince some infertility doctors not to push men to start treatment right away, without first looking for possible causes of the  infertility.</p>

<p>THURSDAY, Sept. 30 (HealthDay News) -- When it comes to the onset of early Alzheimer's disease, a person's family and close friends are better able to spot the initial signs of trouble than traditional screening by doctors, new research suggests.</p>

<p>The finding, reported online in the journal <i>Brain</i>, is based on the apparent accuracy of observations gathered from family and friends in response to a carefully designed dementia questionnaire that is available in several languages and is already in use in clinics worldwide.</p>

<p>Called Ascertain Dementia 8 (or AD8), the questionnaire is designed to draw out  observations on someone's judgment, activity levels, learning capacity, forgetfulness, repetitiveness and overall thinking skills.</p>

<p>Answers given by family and friends to the questionnaire, which can be completed in two minutes, appear to correlate accurately with biological indicators of Alzheimer's disease more often than standard physician testing, the researchers found.</p>

<p>They evaluated data from questionnaires about more than 250 people who had  completed traditional screenings for dementia and had been given spinal fluid tests and brain plaque scans to look for biological markers of the disease.</p>

<p> "Based on our results, the AD8 appears to be superior to conventional testing in its ability to detect signs of early dementia," co-author Dr. John C. Morris, director of the Knight Alzheimer's Disease Research Center at the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, said in a university news release.</p>

<p>"It can't tell us whether the dementia is caused by Alzheimer's or other disorders, but it lets us know when there's a need for more extensive evaluations to answer that question," he explained.</p>

<p>Morris also suggested that the questionnaire technique could serve as a fast and inexpensive answer to the financial hurdle of testing all potential Alzheimer's disease patients for disease biomarkers.</p>

<p>"The AD8 gives us a brief and very low-cost alternative that takes a few minutes . . . to screen for dementia and thus identify those individuals who need follow-up evaluations to determine if there truly are signs of Alzheimer's," he said.</p>

<p>Family- and friend-driven observations, based on continuous close contact, also may give a better picture of the progression of disease, he said, given that a test at a doctor's office can give only a snapshot of the person's condition at a single moment in time.</p>

<p>"These informants can give us the retrospective perspective we need to know that a person's mental abilities have begun to meaningfully decline, indicating that additional testing is needed," Morris said.</p>
