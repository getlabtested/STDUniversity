<BODY><![CDATA[<p>THURSDAY, May 6 (HealthDay News) -- Women who use hormonal contraception such as birth control pills may be at higher risk for having sexual problems than women who use no contraception or non-hormonal contraception, a new study suggests.</p>

<p>The research isn't the first to find such a link, said Dr. Irwin Goldstein, director of sexual medicine at Alvarado Hospital in San Diego and a clinical professor of surgery at the University of California, San Diego. He has found the same link in his own research.</p>

<p>The new study, he said, is "more evidence that when you fool around with hormones, you fool around with your sex life."</p>

<p>The study is published in the current issue of the <i>Journal of Sexual Medicine</i>; Goldstein is the journal's editor-in-chief.</p>

<p>"In general, hormonal contraceptives are well-tolerated and are the best noninvasive method to prevent pregnancy," said study co-author Dr. Harald Seeger, a researcher at University Hospital Tuebingen in Germany. He stressed that the study found a link, not cause-and-effect, and that many other factors come into play that can contribute to sexual problems.</p>

<p>The German research team evaluated 1,086 women, most in a stable relationship with the same partner for six months before answering questions about their sexual functioning and their contraceptive practices.</p>

<p>Using a standard index to measure female sexual function, the researchers found that nearly 33 percent of the women were at risk for female sexual dysfunction. The problems involved a range of factors, such as lack of orgasm, desire, satisfaction, arousal and lubrication.</p>

<p>Most of the women (87 percent) had used contraceptives in the past six months, and more than 97 percent had been sexually active in the past four weeks.</p>

<p>Oral contraceptives were the most popular, used by 69.5 percent of the women, followed by condoms (22.5 percent) and the vaginal contraceptive ring (7.3 percent). Others used a contraceptive implant, intrauterine methods, fertility awareness or other methods.</p>

<p>The researchers then zeroed in on the type of contraception and sexual functioning, excluding 11 women who used more than one type.</p>

<p>Women using non-hormonal contraceptives (such as condoms) were at lowest risk for sexual dysfunction. At next lowest risk were those using no birth control, the study authors found. At highest risk were those using non-oral hormonal contraception, followed by those using oral hormonal contraceptives.</p>

<p>When the researchers looked just at the desire and arousal parameters, both hormonal groups were at highest risk.</p>

<p>"Our data show that hormonal contraception in particular was associated with lower desire and arousal scores when compared with other contraceptives," the authors wrote.</p>

<p>Researchers can't explain the link, but one possibility is that oral contraceptives have been found to reduce circulating levels of androgens, perhaps leading to low circulating levels of testosterone, needed to trigger desire.</p>

<p>Other factors found to affect sexual functioning, the researchers noted, included stress, which was linked with lower desire, and relationship stability, which was linked with higher orgasm scores but lower desire, at least in the short-term.</p>

<p>Denise Bradley, a spokeswoman for Teva Pharmaceuticals, which makes oral contraceptives, said the company had no comment.</p>

<p>Goldstein said the new research points to the need for physicians to warn their patients about the possibility of a sexual dysfunction risk with contraceptive use. "From my point of view, this is more evidence that physicians should spend one extra minute [to tell patients], 'If you want contraception and want to use the oral pill, it may affect your sexual functioning.'"</p>

<HEADLINE><![CDATA[Hepatitis Infections Behind U.S. Rise in Liver Cancer]]></HEADLINE>
<BLURB><![CDATA[More people need to be vaccinated, diagnosed and treated, CDC report says]]></BLURB>
<BYLINE><![CDATA[<b>By Steven Reinberg</b><br><i>HealthDay Reporter</i>]]></BYLINE>
<BODY><![CDATA[<p>THURSDAY, May 6 (HealthDay News) -- A type of liver cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, is increasing in the United States, and health officials attribute much of the rise to untreated hepatitis infections.</p>

<p>Chronic hepatitis B and hepatitis C are responsible for 78 percent of hepatocellular carcinoma around the world. In the United States, as many as 5.3 million people have chronic viral hepatitis and don't know it, according to the May 6 <i>Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report</i> from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).</p>

<p>"The liver cancer rates are increasing in contrast to most other major forms of cancer," said Dr. John Ward, director of CDC's viral hepatitis division and co-author of the report. Viral hepatitis is a major reason for the increase, he said.</p>
 
<p>The rate of hepatocellular carcinoma increased from 2.7 per 100,000 persons in 2001 to 3.2 in 2006 -- an average annual increase of 3.5 percent, according to the report. The highest rates are seen among Asian Pacific Islanders and blacks, the CDC researchers noted.</p>

<p>This is of concern because opportunities exist for prevention, Ward noted. "There is a vaccine against hepatitis B that is routinely given to infants -- so our children are protected, but adults, for the most part, are not," he said.</p>

<p>In addition, good treatments exist for both hepatitis B and C, Ward explained. "These will be even more effective in the future when new drugs currently in development come on the market," he said. </p>

<p>It takes decades of infection with hepatitis before cancer develops, and Ward said a lot of new cases are among older people who were infected before vaccines or effective treatments were available.  </p>

<p>Screening of anyone with chronic hepatitis is essential to prevent or treat liver cancer, Ward pointed out. </p>

<p>Others who should be screened, he said, include people born in Asia, Africa and Eastern Europe, where hepatitis B is endemic; gay men; injection drug users; and hemodialysis patients.</p>

<p>Hepatitis C was only identified in 1990, he added, so people who had contact with a blood product in the 1980s or earlier also need to be screened for hepatitis C.</p>
 
<p>"In the long term, like 20 or 30 years and beyond, our prospects are very bright as far as preventing liver cancer from viral hepatitis," Ward said. </p>

<p>"But  we still have about 50,000 persons who become infected with hepatitis every year and we would like to get that rate lower still," he said.</p>

<p>May is Hepatitis Awareness Month, Ward noted. "Ask your doctor for vaccination for hepatitis B, and ask if you should be screened for hepatitis B or C," he said.</p> 

<p>According to Dr. Eugene Schiff, director of the Center for Liver Diseases at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, early diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma is essential to prevent cancer, and diagnosing cancer early is essential to successfully treating it.</p>

<p>"Unfortunately, the majority of cases that are referred in with a diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma, it's already too far advanced," Schiff said.</p>

<p>Public education campaigns are key because most people with hepatitis don't know it, added an infectious disease expert, Dr. Marc Siegel, an associate professor of medicine at NYU Langone Medical Center.</p>

<p>This should include a massive vaccination campaign against hepatitis B, Siegel said. Eventually, a vaccine for hepatitis C will be developed, "but it won't be anytime soon," he noted.</p> 
<p>For now, prevention is the only way to stop hepatitis C from spreading. Since it is commonly spread through sexual contact, "cutting down on the number of partners and using a condom -- these are the main protections," he said.  </p>

<HEADLINE><![CDATA[Needle-Sharing by Sex Workers Tied to Spread of Syphilis]]></HEADLINE>
<BLURB><![CDATA[Study near U.S.-Mexico border also cites risk of HIV]]></BLURB>
<BYLINE><![CDATA[]]></BYLINE>
<BODY><![CDATA[<p>THURSDAY, May 6 (HealthDay News) -- Needle-sharing among drug abusers may play as big a role as risky sexual behavior in the transmission of syphilis, a new study suggests.</p>

<p>American and Mexican researchers interviewed more than 900 female sex workers in the Mexican border towns of Tijuana and Ciudad Juarez, which are adjacent to San Diego and El Paso, Texas, respectively. The sex workers, who were also tested for HIV and sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), operate legally in the two Mexican towns, which are located on major drug trafficking routes.</p>

<p>The researchers found that female sex workers who didn't have HIV, but tested positive for active syphilis infection, were more likely than those without active syphilis infection to inject drugs, to use illegal drugs before or during sex in the past month, and to have U.S. clients who had higher rates of drug use, including the use of injection drugs.</p>

<p>"As more than two-thirds of these women have clients from the U.S., our data suggest that U.S. men seeking paid sex across the border in Mexico are at considerable risk of acquiring and transmitting syphilis and other STDs," study co-author Steffanie A. Strathdee, associate dean for Global Health Sciences and chief of the Division of Global Public Health at the University of California, San Diego, said in a news release.</p>

<p>STD clinics in Tijuana and Ciudad Juarez should provide users with access to sterile syringes, and needle exchange programs should offer rapid, on-site testing for syphilis, Strathdee said.</p>

<p>Failure to control the spread of syphilis among injection drug users could also increase the spread of HIV, the virus that causes AIDS.</p>

<p>"Because syphilis is a co-factor for HIV, when an HIV epidemic occurs among drug users, high rates of syphilis could be a contributing factor that promotes the HIV epidemic," Strathdee said. "Men who have unprotected sex with female sex workers who have syphilitic sores are much more likely to acquire HIV because the two organisms exacerbate each other."</p>

<p>The study was published online recently in the journal <i>Addiction</i>.</p>
