<HEADLINE><![CDATA[Gay Couples Vulnerable to HIV When Monogamy Is Unsure]]></HEADLINE>
<BLURB><![CDATA[Survey finds that for 8 percent of couples, one partner believes bond is monogamous, but other does not]]></BLURB>

<BODY><![CDATA[<p>THURSDAY, July 15 (HealthDay News) -- A new study finds that 8 percent of gay male couples surveyed in the San Francisco area have differing views about whether their relationships are monogamous -- potentially putting some men at an unknowing risk of being infected with HIV.</p>

<p>The survey of 566 couples found that 45 percent said they were monogamous and slightly more said they were in open relationships. Other studies have come up with similar numbers, noted study lead author Colleen C. Hoff, a sexuality researcher.</p>

<p>However, the finding that a sizeable minority of partnered gay men are confused as to whether their bond is monogamous or not is a new finding, she said. "If one is having sex with someone outside the relationship, and the other doesn't know it, it could be an opportunity for risk [of HIV infection] for both partners," said Hoff, director of San Francisco State University's Center for Research on Gender and Sexuality. </p>

<p>Hoff and colleagues found the participants for the 2005-2007 survey through bars, coffeehouses, restaurants and advertisements in the San Francisco area.</p>

<p>Researchers asked the couples to separately answer questions about their sex lives. The researchers didn't tell the men about the answers given by their partners.</p>

<p>All but a tiny number of the couples reported having an agreement regarding sex: 45 percent agreed that they were in monogamous relationships, and 47 percent agreed that their relationships were open -- they could sleep with other people. </p>

<p>But in 8 percent of the couples, one partner thought the relationship was open and the other thought it was monogamous.</p>

<p>It wasn't necessarily true that partners were being dishonest, she said. "We just know that they have a different understanding of what the agreement is. It could be they weren't very clear from the beginning. It could be that their needs and desires have changed but they didn't talk about it, or they may have drifted away from the agreement and assumed the partner had, too."</p>

<p>The researchers also found the couples who agreed on the ground rules didn't necessarily create agreements -- and follow them -- in order to prevent HIV infection. "The primary motivating force is that these couples want to have a good relationship," she said. </p>

<p>Garrett Prestage, an HIV researcher in Australia, said the study findings should be interpreted cautiously because researchers may make assumptions based on their understanding of relationships among heterosexual couples. </p>

<p>Even so, Prestage said the research may lead to better understanding of sexual relationships between gay male couples and how they may affect their risk of HIV infection.</p>

<p>The findings show that it's wrong to assume that gay male couples make decisions about their relationships based on their concerns about HIV, said Prestage, an associate professor at the National Center in HIV Epidemiology &amp; Clinical Research at the University of New South Wales.</p>

<p>"What matters in any relationship is the trust and interdependence of those involved," he said. "Rational considerations about infections, and most other things, usually take a backseat to these."</p>

<p>He added: "Unfortunately, most HIV prevention seems to be predicated on a message that implies they (gay men) should not trust their partners and should always act out of self-interest. That runs contrary to most healthy relationships."</p>

<p>The study, funded by the U.S. National Institute of Mental Health, is published in the July issue of the journal <i>AIDS Care</i>.</p>

<HEADLINE><![CDATA[More Study Urged on Risks, Benefits of Earlier HIV Therapy]]></HEADLINE>
<BLURB><![CDATA[Increased death risk noted in patients currently not recommended to start antiretrovirals: study]]></BLURB>
<BYLINE><![CDATA[]]></BYLINE>
<BODY><![CDATA[<p>THURSDAY, July 15 (HealthDay News) -- Among HIV patients with a high level of CD4 immune cells, those who aren't taking antiretroviral therapy have a moderately increased risk of death, a new study has found.</p>

<p>The researchers said their findings point to the need for continuing studies to examine the risks and benefits of starting antiretroviral therapy, or ART, for patients with high CD4 cell counts.</p>

<p>As HIV infection progresses, CD4 cell levels decrease. Currently, treatment with ART is recommended when a patient's CD4 count drops below 350 cells per microliter.</p>

<p>For this study, researchers examined data from 40,830 HIV patients, aged 20 to 59, in Europe and North America, who had at least one CD4 count greater than 350 cells per microliter while not taking ART. The patients were divided into four risk groups: men who have sex with men, heterosexuals, injection drug users, and those with other or unknown risk factors.</p>

<p>An analysis of 401 of 419 deaths revealed that the risk of death compared to the general population was 30 percent higher for men who have sex with men, 2.94  times higher for heterosexuals, 9.37 times higher for injection drug users, and 4.57 times higher for those with other or unknown risk factors.</p>

<p>Compared to patients with CD4 counts of 350-499 cells per microliter, the death rate was 23 percent lower in patients with counts of 500-699 cells per microliter, and 34 percent lower for those with counts of 700 cells or more per microliter, according to the study findings, which were published online July 15 in <i>The Lancet</i>.</p>

<p>"The increase in risk was substantial in injecting drug users and the heterosexual group but was small in men who have sex with men [MSM]. This finding suggests that much of the raised risk in the former two risk groups probably results from confounding by socioeconomic and lifestyle factors rather than being an effect of HIV infection itself," Rebecca Lodwick of the HIV Epidemiology and Biostatistics Group at University College London Medical School, and colleagues wrote in their report. </p>

<p>"The magnitude of the raised risk in the MSM group is more likely to reflect the effect of HIV itself," they noted in a news release from the journal's publisher. </p>

<p>"These data suggest that HIV may increase the risk of death in people who have not taken ART and have CD4 count greater than 350 cells per microliter, but any such increase appears relatively modest. Because ART might reduce the risk of death in such patients, these findings support the need for continuing studies of the risks and benefits of starting ART at CD4 counts greater than 350 cells per microliter," they concluded.</p>
