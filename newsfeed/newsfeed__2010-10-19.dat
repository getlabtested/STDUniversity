<BODY><![CDATA[<p>MONDAY, Oct. 18 (HealthDay News) -- Bristol-Myers Squibb said Monday its liver drug Baraclude (entecavir) has received expanded approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to treat chronic hepatitis B in adults with decompensated liver disease, a form of severe liver damage.</p>

<p>Baraclude was first approved in 2005 for adults with compensated liver disease, a less severe form of damage that means the liver still functions properly, the drug maker said in a news release.</p> 
 
<p>Decompensated liver disease, by contrast, refers to failure of the liver to maintain adequate function, commonly due to severe scarring. Chronic hepatitis B often causes chronic liver inflammation, which can lead to decompensated liver disease, the drug maker said.</p>

<p>About 1.25 million Americans are infected with chronic hepatitis B, Bristol said.</p>
