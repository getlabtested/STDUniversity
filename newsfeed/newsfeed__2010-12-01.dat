<p>WEDNESDAY, Dec. 1 (HealthDay News) -- One January day in 1991, career journalist Jane Fowler, then 55, opened a letter from a health insurance company informing her that her request for coverage had been denied due to a "significant blood abnormality."</p>

<p>This was the first inkling -- later confirmed in her doctor's office -- that the Kansas City, Kan., native had contracted HIV from someone she had dated five years before, a man she'd been friends with her entire adult life.  She had begun seeing him two years after the end of her 24-year marriage.</p>

<p>Fowler, now 75 and healthy thanks to the advent of antiretroviral medications, recalls being devastated by her diagnosis.</p>

<p>"I went home that day and literally took to my bed. I thought, 'What's going to happen?'" she said. For the next four years Fowler, once an active and successful writer and editor, lived in what she called "semi-isolation," staying mostly in her apartment.</p>

<p>Then came the dawning realization that her isolation wasn't helping anyone, least of all herself.</p>

<p>Fowler slowly began reaching out to experts and other older Americans to learn more about living with HIV in life's later decades. By 1995, she had helped co-found the National Association on HIV Over 50. And through her program, HIV Wisdom for Older Women, Fowler today speaks to audiences nationwide on the challenges of living with the virus.</p>

<p>"I decided to speak out -- to put an old, wrinkled, white, heterosexual face to this disease," she said. "But my message isn't age-specific: We all need to understand that we can be at risk."</p>

<p>That message may be more urgent than ever this Wednesday, World AIDS Day. During a recent White House forum on HIV and aging, at which Fowler spoke, experts presented new data suggesting that as the HIV/AIDS epidemic enters its fourth decade those afflicted by it are aging, too. </p>

<p>One report, conducted by the AIDS Community Research Initiative of America (ACRIA), noted that 27 percent of Americans diagnosed with HIV are now aged 50 or older and by 2015 that percentage could double.</p>

<p>Why? According to Dr. Michael Horberg, vice chair of the HIV Medicine Association, there's been a societal "perfect storm" that's led to more HIV infections among people in middle age or older.</p>

<p>"Certainly the rise of Viagra and similar drugs to treat erectile dysfunction, people are getting more sexually active because they are more able to do so," Horberg said.  There's also the perception that HIV is now treatable with complex drug regimens, he said, even though these medicines often come with onerous side effects.</p>

<p>For her part, Fowler said that more and more aging Americans find themselves recently divorced (as she did) or widowed and back in the dating game. </p>

<p>And all too often, doctors fail to appreciate that their patients over 50 might still have active sex lives, so the possibility of sexually transmitted diseases is often overlooked.</p>

<p>"Often, they're tested [for HIV] too late," Fowler said. "Many have already been diagnosed with full-blown AIDS. In fact, that's often how the diagnosis comes."  At that point, it's much tougher for AIDS drugs to do their job of suppressing HIV.</p> 

<p>Aging with HIV presents other problems, as well. According to ACRIA's survey of about 1,000 HIV-positive men and women, 91 percent are battling other chronic medical conditions associated with age, including arthritis, neuropathies and high blood pressure.  Many are coping with these conditions on their own: 70 percent of older Americans with HIV live alone, the report found, more than twice the rate of their non-infected contemporaries.</p>

<p>Adding HIV and its often potent drug treatment to the usual troubles of aging can be tough. Speaking at the White House conference, Dr. Amy Justice, principal investigator of the Veterans Aging Cohort Study, which involves more than 40,000 veterans with HIV, said: "There are a lot of [infected] people who are 60 or 65 or even 80 or 85. These people feel older than their stated age and may have some of the same problems people 10 or 15 years older would normally experience."</p>

<p>According to Horberg, many of the diseases of aging "are made worse by HIV or its treatment."  For example, he said, the AIDS drug tenofovir can impair kidney function, other antiretrovirals cannot be taken with cholesterol-lowering drugs such as Zocor or Mevacor, and it's suspected that HIV infection might even accelerate the onset of Alzheimer's disease. </p>

<p>Issues of HIV prevention and treatment can be especially tough on older women, said Diane Zablotsky, an associate professor of sociology at the University of North Carolina who's worked on the issue.</p>

<p>In terms of prevention, she noted that it may be tougher for a woman past menopause to negotiate condom use with a partner, when pregnancy is no longer an issue.  And in terms of diagnosis and treatment, "if you have a woman experiencing night sweats and other kinds of symptoms -- is that menopausal change? A medication issue? Or is it an HIV-infection issue?"</p>

<p>All of the experts stressed that the key to curbing HIV infection in older Americans is the same as it is for the young: prevention. But that will mean having much franker discussions about sex.</p>

<p>"There's this myth that older people aren't sexually active," Fowler said. "Health-care providers could help by taking sexual histories, but they don't because they assume they don't have to. They can ask about smoking and alcohol use, but sex? Oh no, the person is old."</p>

<p>Zablotsky agreed. "The important thing is to reach out to older people in a way which -- if in fact they are engaging in behavior that puts them at risk -- they have a reason to say, 'I need to listen to this, I need to make this change, I need to protect myself.'"</p>

<HEADLINE><![CDATA[Hair Stylists Mobilize to Snip Away Ignorance of HIV/AIDS]]></HEADLINE>
<BLURB><![CDATA[Hairdressers Against AIDS campaign launched to promote stylist-client chats across U.S.]]></BLURB>
<BYLINE><![CDATA[<b>By Alan Mozes</b><br><i>HealthDay Reporter</i>]]></BYLINE>
<BODY><![CDATA[<p>WEDNESDAY, Dec. 1 (HealthDay News) -- Could the prevention of HIV infection and AIDS be a comb, fluff and blow-dry away?</p>

<p>That's the idea behind an innovative new national outreach effort, Hairdressers Against AIDS, which got its launch Tuesday at the United Nations in New York City, ahead of Dec. 1, World AIDS Day. </p>

<p>The initiative -- described as "one of the largest HIV/AIDS mobilization campaigns in U.S. history" -- has hair care giant L'Oreal joining forces with nonprofits such as the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) and the Global Business Coalition on HIV/AIDS, TB and Malaria (GBC).</p>

<p>The goal is to empower America's 500,000-plus hair stylists to use the relationships they have with millions of clients for salon-based chats on the how, why and what of HIV.</p>

<p>"Today there is no vaccine," noted GBC president and CEO John Tedstrom, speaking to 500 hairdressers who'd gathered at the UN for the launch. "There is no cure. We're getting there. But today there is only information. The more we talk, the more we educate, the more we prevent the spread of this epidemic," Tedstrom explained.</p>

<p>"You'll see millions of people hearing about HIV from people that they know," he said. "They'll be hearing effective time-tested messages about HIV prevention, and they'll be able to take those messages back to their personal relationships. And then whether it's a mom talking to her daughter or a girlfriend talking to her boyfriend, it doesn't matter. We'll be able to have an adult conversation about HIV and sexual health."</p>

<p>Using hair-care professionals to get health messages out to the masses isn't a novel idea.  Recent studies have shown, for example, that black men can be motivated by barbershop messages to improve their blood pressure or get educated about their risk for prostate cancer.  And the U.S. launch of Hairdressers Against AIDS is just the latest extension of a global HIV awareness effort that's already in place in 30 countries throughout the world.</p> 

<p>Hairdressers Against AIDS will first offer in-depth HIV/AIDS background training to 1,200 "salon educators," relying on the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as their prime source for HIV/AIDS information and prevention advice. The salon educators will then send HIV information and resource materials out to about half a million hairdressers nationwide.</p>

<p> Christine Schuster, L'Oreal vice president of education and campaign chair, called the effort an "advocacy program" that will capitalize on salons' key role in communities to help dispel myths, such as the idea that HIV is no longer a significant health threat or that AIDS is now curable.</p>

<p>In fact, the campaign notes that 1.1 million Americans are still living with HIV and every 9.5 minutes another American becomes infected. About one-fifth of those infected are thought to be unaware of their status.</p>

<p>"We want to get the conversation started," Schuster said, noting that the nation's half-million hairdressers come into contact with an average of 20 million clients per week. "There's no better place to have a conversation than in your local salon."</p>

<p>Within its first year, the U.S. campaign hopes to reach upwards of 110 million American salon-goers, one haircut at a time.</p>

<p>Outreach started in earnest on Wednesday, with all 500 stylists who attended the UN launch headed to Times Square with video cameras to shoot grassroots HIV prevention videos. The finished products will be posted on the campaign's  Web site, as well as on other social media forums such as Facebook, to jumpstart the education process.</p>

<p>"Education is key," said Johnny Wright, a celebrity hair stylist involved in the project who counts First Lady Michelle Obama as one of his clients. "As hair stylists we have a vital voice to help educate. So that means talking about using a condom, getting tested, knowing your partner's status, knowing your own status, knowing about the celibacy option if that's appropriate for you. All that needs to be talked about. And I find it can be very easy for us as hairdressers to communicate all this to our clients."</p>

<p>GBC's Tedstrom seconded that notion, calling Hairdressers Against AIDS "a tremendous opportunity to make a big difference."</p>

<HEADLINE><![CDATA['Don't Ask, Don't Tell' May Put Soldiers' Health at Risk, Doctor Says]]></HEADLINE>
<BLURB><![CDATA[Gay service members with STDs often avoid military doctors or go undiagnosed]]></BLURB>
<BYLINE><![CDATA[]]></BYLINE>
<BODY><![CDATA[<p>WEDNESDAY, Dec. 1 (HealthDay News) - A physician with experience caring for armed forces personnel says the U.S. military's "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" policy puts both service members and the general public at risk by encouraging secrecy about sexual health issues.</p>

<p>"Infections go undiagnosed. Service members and their partners go untreated," Dr. Kenneth Katz, a physician at San Diego State University and the University of California at San Diego, wrote in a commentary published Dec. 1 in the <i>New England Journal of Medicine</i>. </p>

<p>And civilians "pay a price" because they have sex with service members who miss out on programs aimed at preventing the spread of the HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, as well as other sexually transmitted diseases, Katz wrote.</p>

<p>The military is currently pondering the end of the "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" policy, which does not allow gay service members to serve openly. No one knows how many gays are in the armed forces. However, one 2002 study found that active-duty Navy sailors made up 9 percent of the patients who visited one gay men's health clinic in San Diego.</p>

<p>Katz writes that he treated one active-duty gay member of the military who visited a sexually transmitted disease clinic in San Diego and was diagnosed with gonorrhea. Even though the military covered the man's medical expenses, he feared his career would be jeopardized if he went to a military doctor over issues of sexual health. </p>

<p>The U.S. military has said it will no longer use confidential medical information in its efforts to ferret out gay service members. But Katz writes that service members have told him that they haven't heard about  such a change. </p>

<p>In an interview, a psychologist who studies sexual orientation issues said that Katz "may be underselling the risks" posed to service members who must keep their personal lives private in order to avoid losing their jobs. </p>

<p>Research has shown that the act of inhibiting oneself is unhealthy, according to David Huebner, an assistant professor of psychology at the University of Utah. </p>

<p>On the other hand, he said, "if you disclose things that are personally difficult to you in a constructive way, your physical health can improve."</p>

<p>Physicians often deal with mental health issues,  Heubner added, and they'll be hobbled if service members aren't open about themselves. </p>
