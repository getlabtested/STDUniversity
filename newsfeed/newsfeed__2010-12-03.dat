<BODY><![CDATA[<p>FRIDAY, Dec. 3 (HealthDay News) -- Genetics might help explain why some people are more prone to infidelity and promiscuity, says a new study.</p>

<p>Researchers analyzed the DNA of 181 young adults who provided a complete history of their sexual activity and intimate partnerships. They concluded that the dopamine receptor D4 (DRD4) gene plays a major role in sexual behavior.</p>

<p>Previous research has linked the DRD4 gene, which influences brain chemistry, to sensation-seeking activities such as gambling and alcohol use.</p>

<p>"What we found was that individuals with a certain variant of the DRD4 gene were more likely to have a history of uncommitted sex, including one-night stands and acts of infidelity," study leader Justin Garcia, of the laboratory of evolutionary anthropology and health at Binghamton University, State University of New York, said in a university news release.</p>

<p>"The motivation seems to stem from a system of pleasure and reward, which is where the release of dopamine comes in. In cases of uncommitted sex, the risks are high, the rewards substantial and the motivation variable -- all elements that ensure a dopamine 'rush,'" Garcia explained.</p>

<p>The findings, published in the current issue of the online journal <i>PLoS One</i>, shouldn't be viewed as an excuse for cheating or promiscuity, Garcia stressed.</p>

<p>"These [gene-behavior] relationships are associative, which means that not everyone with the genotype will have one-night stands or commit infidelity. Indeed, many people without this genotype still have one-night stands and commit infidelity," Garcia said. "The study merely suggests that a much higher proportion of those with this genetic type are likely to engage in these behaviors."</p>

<HEADLINE><![CDATA[Dramatic Decline Seen in AIDS News Coverage]]></HEADLINE>
<BLURB><![CDATA[Since 1990, number of newspaper articles about HIV/AIDS has dropped in richer nations]]></BLURB>
<BYLINE><![CDATA[]]></BYLINE>
<BODY><![CDATA[<p>FRIDAY, Dec. 3 (HealthDay News) -- If the expression "out of sight, out of mind" is true, then wealthier nations may be at risk of forgetting about the global AIDS pandemic, according to an international team of researchers.</p>

<p>Media coverage of HIV/AIDS fell more than 70 percent in developed countries over the last two decades, according to a study that tracked coverage in 115 leading broadsheet newspapers in 41 countries from 1990 until May 2010. In the early 1990s, an average of 1.5 articles about HIV/AIDS was found in every issue of the newspapers. That has fallen to less than 0.5 articles since 2008.</p>

<p>The decline in HIV/AIDS-related articles has been particularly dramatic in American and French newspapers, the researchers noted.</p>

<p>While media coverage of HIV/AIDS has decreased in some nations, coverage has remained at a high level or increased in areas hardest hit by the AIDS pandemic, such as South Africa.</p>

<p>The research was conducted as part of an ongoing project to track worldwide media coverage of sustainability issues such as human rights, poverty and climate change. The Trends in Sustainability project includes researchers from the University of Leeds and Queen's University Belfast in the United Kingdom, the Institute for Future Studies and Technology Assessment in Berlin, Germany, and Euromed Management School in Marseille, France.</p>

<p>"HIV/AIDS has emerged as a key issue that increasingly tends to be treated with neglect by newspapers based in the developed [northern areas of the world]," Frank Figge, of Queen's University Management School in Belfast, said in a University of Leeds news release. "This does not necessarily come as a surprise, as the remarkable progress that has been made in tackling HIV/AIDS has also largely been restricted to the wealthy North. Hence, the problem itself has shifted towards the global South."</p>

<p>The vast majority of HIV/AIDS research occurs in the developed nations, so the apparent lack of interest in those countries may harm efforts to find ways to fight the spreading AIDS pandemic in developing nations, the researchers said.</p>

<HEADLINE><![CDATA[Research Finds Not All HIV Affects Immune System Same Way]]></HEADLINE>
<BLURB><![CDATA[In some cases, virus has mutations that keep it from killing immune cells, study finds]]></BLURB>
<BYLINE><![CDATA[]]></BYLINE>
<BODY><![CDATA[<p>FRIDAY, Dec. 3 (HealthDay News) -- New research explains why immune function actually improves in a small number of  patients with drug-resistant HIV.</p>

<p>In those cases, the virus has mutations that protect it against some HIV drugs but also thwart its ability to kill immune cells, explained the researchers at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn.</p>

<p>This is the first study to show that not all HIV is equally bad for the immune system, the authors noted.</p>

<p>"These findings suggest -- in contrast to how these patients have been treated in the past -- that changing treatments might not be needed in order to help the immune system," senior author and infectious disease researcher Dr. Andrew Badley, said in a Mayo news release.</p>

<p>The study is published in the Nov. 24 online edition of the journal <i>PLoS Pathogens</i>.</p>

<p>HIV causes AIDS by progressively killing CD4 T-cells that direct the immune system. The loss of these cells makes patients susceptible to infections and cancers. Over time, HIV can develop mutations that make it resistant to drugs. But only a few of those mutations also halt HIV's ability to kill immune cells, the researchers explained in the news release.</p>
