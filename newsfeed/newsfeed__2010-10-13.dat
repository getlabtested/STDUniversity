<HEADLINE><![CDATA[Studies Tout Alternative HIV Regimens for Women, Babies]]></HEADLINE>

<BODY><![CDATA[<p>WEDNESDAY, Oct. 13 (HealthDay News) -- New research suggests that alternative drug regimens in poor countries could help HIV-infected mothers and their infants more effectively fight off the virus that causes AIDS.</p>

<p>Currently, doctors lower the risk of transmission of mother-to-baby HIV infection by giving a drug to mothers right before birth and to babies right after. About half of the babies avoid getting HIV, but mothers and babies who do get infected often develop resistance to the drug, which is typically given to them later in life. </p>

<p>Enter the alternatives. "We now have a very effective treatment for women who've taken a specific drug and for babies at risk," said Dr. Shahin Lockman, lead author of one of two studies about the regimens in the Oct. 14 issue of the <i>New England Journal of Medicine</i>. </p>

<p>There's a big hitch, however: the alternative regimens are much more expensive than the current drug regimen, although the study authors weren't able to give an estimate of the difference in costs between the regimens.</p>

<p>At stake are the lives of hundreds of thousands, perhaps millions, of women who are infected with HIV, said Lockman, an assistant professor at Harvard Medical School.</p>

<p>In many cases, HIV-positive women in poor countries -- such as those in Africa --  receive treatment with the inexpensive anti-HIV drug nevirapine shortly before they give birth. The idea is that the drug will reduce the risk that the baby will become infected with HIV during labor and delivery.</p>

<p>The problem is that in some cases, the AIDS virus develops resistance to the drug and the drug then doesn't work as well after an initial treatment. Even so, nevirapine is still used to treat both mothers and infected babies after birth.</p>

<p>Researchers have been looking for alternative treatments that have less risk of failing because the virus can escape the drug's effects. In the new studies, they tested different regimens, trying to find the ones that will allow more mothers or babies to push the level of HIV in their blood to zero. (They won't be cured if that happens, but they will stave off the development of the disease.)</p>

<p>In one study, researchers gave either of two treatments to 241 African women who'd taken a single dose of nevirapine at least six months earlier. Twenty-six percent of those who took a regimen that included nevirapine either died or failed to beat back the virus,  compared to 8 percent of those who took the other regimen. The regimens were nevirapine plus tenofovir-emtricitabine or ritonavir-boosted lopinavir plus tenofovir-emtricitabine.</p>

<p>In the other study, researchers tested two regimens -- zidovudine and lamivudine plus nevirapine, or zidovudine and lamivudine plus ritonavir-boosted lopinavir -- in HIV-infected babies aged 6 months to 3 years. Only about 60 percent of the babies on the nevirapine regimen managed to both beat back the virus and survive, compared to about 78 percent of the other babies. </p>

<p>The results in the babies were so clear that the researchers ended their study early. Another study, which hopes to determine the best treatment for infected babies who didn't get nevirapine at birth, is continuing. </p>

<p>Nevirapine by itself is inexpensive, but many pregnant mothers in poor countries still aren't given it to prevent transmission to their babies, said Dr. Paul E. Palumbo, lead author of the second study and director of the International Pediatric HIV Program at Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center.</p>

<p>The cost will be a big challenge to providing the alternative regimens, both researchers say. "When you're already struggling to provide drugs and then you goose the cost dramatically by changing the regimen, it really requires a lot of creativity and problem-solving," Palumbo said. "It could take years for even the beginning of implementation, and many years before it's more comprehensively implemented."</p>

<p>Still, Lockman -- the lead author of the study of mothers -- said there's a "moral and ethical obligation to try to help the mothers who put their health on the line to prevent their babies from getting infected."</p>

<p>As for nevirapine, it is problematic but remains "a very useful drug, and there are many solutions to this problem," said Dr. Marc Lallemant, an AIDS specialist at Harvard School of Public Health and co-author of a commentary accompanying the study. "The bottom line is that it is an absolute priority to avoid HIV infection in children in the first place."</p>

<HEADLINE><![CDATA[Club Drug 'Poppers' May Be Linked to Eye Damage]]></HEADLINE>
<BLURB><![CDATA[Not yet clear how widespread these cases might be, experts say]]></BLURB>
<BYLINE><![CDATA[<b>By Alan Mozes</b><br><i>HealthDay Reporter</i>]]></BYLINE>
<BODY><![CDATA[<p>WEDNESDAY, Oct. 13 (HealthDay News) -- The legal recreational drugs known as "poppers" appear to be linked to light sensitivity and vision loss in at least several healthy individuals, a new French review of cases reveals.</p>

<p>Poppers -- a catch-all term for alkyl nitrites that are often inhaled by partyers for a brief "head rush" and to increase sexual arousal -- may compromise the normal workings of photoreceptor cells found in a key region of the eye's retina, the researchers say.</p>

<p>"We believe that in fact this complication is quite common," said Dr. Michel Paques of the Quinze-Vingts National Hospital in Paris. However, early data suggests that "only a minority of [affected] consumers will show up to the ophthalmologist," he added. That's because popper-related retinal damage may not noticeably affect vision in some cases and may therefore go undiagnosed, he said.</p>

<p>Paques and his colleagues report their observations, based on four patients, in a correspondence to the Oct. 14 issue of the <i>New England Journal of Medicine</i>.</p>

<p>Popular for decades particularly among the gay community, poppers are perceived by many as being relatively safe. They are typically sold over the counter in small bottles.</p>

<p>But nitric oxide is known to affect the metabolism of photoreceptors, the authors note, and can also alter the operation of a key enzyme involved in photoreceptor function.</p>

<p>The authors report on four recent cases, which took place earlier this year within a three-month period.</p>

<p>In one instance, a 27-year old woman experienced eye trouble the day after she inhaled poppers (and drank alcohol) at a party. After 11 days of seeing a "central bright dot" in both of her eyes, she sought medical attention.</p>

<p>An exam turned up no prior history of significant health or eye problems. But her eyesight was found to be less than ideal -- 20/50 in the right eye and 20/40 in the left eye -- and she had a yellow dot on the foveal portion of her eyes, alongside damage to the outer photoreceptor segment of both eyes.</p>

<p>The fovea facilitates the sharp central vision needed for reading, driving, and viewing movies.</p>

<p>One month later, her visual symptoms and physical damage remained unchanged, the research team noted.</p>

<p>Over the following three months, three more patients sought care for similar visual symptoms arising after popper use. Although symptoms did not appear to worsen over time, the researchers noted that just two of the four patients have fully recovered. Meanwhile, the exact underlying mechanics of the apparent poppers-vision risk connection remains unclear.</p>

<p> "Those who did stop taking poppers showed progressive recovery over several months," Paques said.</p>

<p>Before these patients sought treatment, the authors note that only two similar cases had been reported over the prior decade. However, Paques said the occurrence may not be as rare as it seems.</p>

<p>"Since our initial (report) we actively searched for new cases and were surprised to find many of them, sometimes not diagnosed by previous ophthalmologists because the retinal abnormalities are in a small -- yet very important --  area of the retina," he said.</p>

<p>Based on their findings, Paques and colleagues advise eye doctors and potential users of poppers to be aware of the potential risk for popper-related retinal toxicity.</p>

<p>"Even a single dose of poppers may affect the retina," he cautioned. Patients should visit an eye doctor "if there are any symptoms such as bright light in the center of the visual field, or if there is persistent visual loss, for instance, difficulty in reading small letters."</p>

<p>Not all eye specialists are alarmed, however.  Dr. Richard Bensinger, a Seattle-based ophthalmologist and spokesman for the American Academy of Ophthalmology, said evidence to date appears to be entirely anecdotal and does not yet suggest a clear cause-and-effect between poppers and vision trouble.</p>

<p>"We have no real detailed history," he noted. "It's just these patients reporting what they had done, and it certainly does sound like there was something in their activity that caused a problem, but it's not necessarily poppers that cause the problem. Because many, many people have taken them all over the planet without any visual incident."</p>

<p>Perhaps the poppers were adulterated in some way, he suggested. "We don't know. So it's worth looking into further," he said.</p>
