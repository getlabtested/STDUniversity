<BODY><![CDATA[<p>(HealthDay News) -- Warts are small bumps, caused by a virus, that develop on the skin. While they're generally not cause for concern, some symptoms indicate that a doctor should examine a wart.</p>

<p>The U.S. National Library of Medicine says you should seek a physician's advice if:</p>

<ul>
<li>The wart bleeds, leaks discharge or pus, has red streaks, or you have a fever.</li>
<li>You want to have the wart removed and it's not going away.</li>
<li>The wart causes pain.</li>
<li>The wart appears on the genitals or anus.</li>
<li>Your immune system is weakened by HIV, or you're diabetic.</li>
<li>The wart changes in appearance or color.</li>
</ul>

<HEADLINE><![CDATA[Placebo Pill Gives Boost to Some Women's Sex Drive]]></HEADLINE>
<BLURB><![CDATA[Researchers were surprised at how strong the effect was]]></BLURB>
<BYLINE><![CDATA[<b>By Jenifer Goodwin</b><br><i>HealthDay Reporter</i>]]></BYLINE>
<BODY><![CDATA[<p>THURSDAY, Sept. 16 (HealthDay News) -- About one-third of women given a placebo pill to treat a low libido reported improvements in their sex lives, a finding researchers say is evidence of the powerful and somewhat mysterious mind-body connection surrounding arousal and desire.</p>

<p>After drugs like Viagra and Cialis revolutionized the treatment of male sexual dysfunction in the late 1990s, a flurry of clinical trials were conducted in women in the hopes that the drugs could do the same to revive a woman's flagging sex drive.</p>

<p>The drugs flopped in women. But recently, researchers went back and looked at the old data on Cialis and found that not only did about 35 percent of women given the placebo pill experience significant improvement in psychological aspects of sex such as desire, many reported improvements in the physical aspects of arousal, including better lubrication, more frequent orgasms or more easily attainable orgasms, according to the study. </p>

<p>"Everything across the board improved in some women," said study author Andrea Bradford, a post-doctoral fellow at the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston.</p>

<p>The study is published in the current issue of the <i>Journal of Sexual Medicine</i>.</p>

<p>In the original study, 50 women aged 35 to 55 who were diagnosed with  female sexual arousal disorder were given either Cialis or a placebo for 12 weeks. The women, most of whom were married, were asked to have sex at least three times a month. "Many went above and beyond," Bradford noted.</p> 

<p>Women also had to keep a diary of how often they had sex and how satisfying it was.</p>

<p>Bradford suspects the improvements were due to several aspects of the study -- the hope that the pill might be working plus speaking with medical professionals about sex, thinking about sex and trying to have better sex.</p>

<p>"I think just the act of attending to their sex lives was very therapeutic for some women," Bradford said.</p>

<p>Over time, the frequency with which women had sex dropped some, but they continued to report better sex lives overall. "It was quality over quantity," she said.</p>

<p>When sex is no longer satisfying, women tend to avoid it, noted Aline Zolbrod, a Boston-area clinical psychologist and sex therapist. Without at least giving it a try, there's little hope sex will get better.</p>

<p>"I love this study," Zolbrod said. "It does what we'd like to get our patients to do, which is to start having sex again. Instead of getting into bed and sighing, 'Oh, this is never going to work,' instead they are getting into bed and thinking, 'Let's see what happens.' When you have that attitude and you have sex almost once a week, for some women it really did the trick."</p>

<p>The ages of 35 to 55 can be difficult for women, who may be balancing careers, family responsibilities and assorted worries that seemingly leave little time to feel erotic, Zolbrod said.</p>

<p>Many women, even those who don't have sexual dysfunction, may be able to learn a bit from the study, she added.</p>

<p>"Just try it. Hope for good things. Don't avoid it. Go in with good expectations. And communicate a little bit about what makes you feel good in your body," Zolbrod said. "Maybe we should all be in a research study. It might help."</p>

<HEADLINE><![CDATA[For Common Warts, Freezing  Therapy Works Best: Study]]></HEADLINE>
<BLURB><![CDATA[Still, no treatment could cure more than half of cases, experts note]]></BLURB>
<BYLINE><![CDATA[<b>By Kathleen Doheny</b><br><i>HealthDay Reporter</i>]]></BYLINE>
<BODY><![CDATA[<p>THURSDAY, Sept. 16 (HealthDay News) -- When it comes to ridding yourself of common warts, freezing -- also known as cryotherapy -- works better than applying salicylic acid, another common treatment, a new Dutch study finds.</p>

<p>No one treatment cured more than half of cases, however, and better treatments for the stubborn skin malady are needed, experts say.</p>

<p>The new finding is a bit of an about-face, according to Dr. Sjoerd Bruggink of Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, who led the research.  That's because an earlier review done by another team found that salicylic acid was the preferred treatment.</p>

<p>But for common warts, Bruggink's group found otherwise. He and his colleagues looked at common warts, found on the fingers, around the nails and on the backs of hands, and at plantar warts, which grow on the soles of the feet.</p>

<p>"Our trial is the first to show that for patients with common warts cryotherapy is most effective," Bruggink said. However, "for patients with plantar warts, the active treatments [freezing or salicylic acid] are not more effective than a wait-and-see approach.''</p>

<p>The study, funded by the Netherlands Organization for Health Research and Development, is published Sept. 13 in the <i>Canadian Medical Association Journal</i>.</p>

<p>Warts are non-cancerous skin growths triggered by a viral infection in the skin's top layer, according to the American Academy of Dermatology. Up to a third of school-age children will develop warts, according to Bruggink, although two-thirds of the growths will go away on their own in two years or less.</p>

<p>Two common treatments for warts are the topical application of salicyclic acid, or cryotherapy, where the wart is frozen away using liquid nitrogen.</p>

<p>For the study, Bruggink tracked outcomes for 250 children and adults, ages 4 to 79, with warts, for 13 weeks. The participants were assigned to either the freezing group, the salicylic acid group or a "wait-and-see" group that got no active treatment.</p>

<p>At 13 weeks, 240 people remained in the trial. The cure rates for common warts (treated in 116 people) was 49 percent for freezing, 15 percent for those receiving salicylic acid and 8 percent for the wait-and-see group.</p>

<p>For the 124 people treated for plantar warts, the cure rate was similar whether they got freezing or salicylic acid. Eleven of 37 people who underwent cryotherapy experienced a "cure" -- disappearance of the wart for 13 weeks -- compared to 14 of 43 people treated with salicylic acid.  Plantar warts resolved on their own in 10 of the 44 patients in the wait-and-see group.</p>

<p>Bruggink said his team will next look at combination treatments for plantar warts.</p>

<p>The Dutch results didn't impress Dr. Steven Feldman, professor of dermatology, pathology and public health sciences at Wake Forest University Baptist Medical Center, Winston-Salem, N.C., who reviewed the study.</p>

<p>"Well, there's clearly one thing they proved: We still need a good treatment for warts," Feldman said. "Most patients did not respond to any of these treatments."</p>

<p>And side effects, including pain, blisters and scarring, were reported, he noted, especially for those who got the freezing therapy.</p>

<p>Another issue, Feldman said, is that salicylic acid, used at home, may not have been used as often as recommended, potentially limiting its effectiveness. On the other hand, people in the freezing treatment group had to return to the office every two weeks, he said, an inconvenience.</p>

<p>There's cost to consider, too: While freezing can cost patients hundreds of dollars, salicylic acid runs to the "tens of dollars" only, Feldman said.</p>

<p>And while the cure rates for freezing were better at 13 weeks, Feldman wonders if the warts might still come back later.</p>
