<p>THURSDAY, Nov. 18 (HealthDay News) -- Social networking might have triggered asthma attacks for one young Italian man, who experienced breathing troubles whenever he accessed an ex-girlfriend's Facebook page.</p>

<p>Doctors are reporting the strange case in the Nov. 20 edition of <i>The Lancet</i>.</p>

<p>The 18-year-old man was depressed because his girlfriend had dumped him and also deleted him from her list of Facebook friends, while "friending" many new young men, the doctors explained in a letter to the journal.</p>

<p>The man, who was taking medications to control his asthma, used a new Facebook nickname to become the girl's friend again and see her picture on her Facebook profile. But every time he saw her picture, he suffered shortness of breath.</p>

<p>"The [man's] mother was advised to ask him to measure the peak expiratory [lung] flow before and after Internet login and, indeed, post-Facebook values were reduced, with a variability of more than 20 percent," write Dr. Gennaro D'Amato, of the High Specialty Hospital A Carderelli in Naples, and colleagues. "In collaboration with a psychiatrist, the patient resigned not to login to Facebook any longer and the asthma attacks stopped."</p>

<p>After taking the man's medical history and giving him a thorough physical examination, the doctors discounted other possible environmental and infectious factors and concluded that seeing his ex-girlfriend's Facebook page triggered the man's asthma attacks.</p>

<p>"This case indicates that Facebook, and social networks in general, could be a new source of psychological stress, representing a triggering factor for exacerbations in depressed asthmatic individuals," the doctors wrote. "Considering the high prevalence of asthma, especially among young people, we suggest that this type of trigger be considered in the assessment of asthma exacerbations."</p>

<HEADLINE><![CDATA[Past Abuse Puts Homeless Youth at Risk for Early Sex: Study]]></HEADLINE>

<BODY><![CDATA[<p>FRIDAY, Nov. 19 (HealthDay News) -- Homeless youth who were sexually abused as children may engage in sex at a young age because they believe sex is a way to get people to like them, a new study suggests.</p>

<p>Canadian researchers gathered information from 179 homeless youth, aged 16 to 21, from five homeless shelters in Toronto and the surrounding area. Nearly 42 percent of them reported they were sexually abused as children. Females were much more likely than males to report sexual abuse -- 62 percent versus 26.9 percent.</p>

<p>Those who were sexually abused had their first sexual encounter, on average, at age 14. That is two to three years younger than the general Canadian population, said the Ryerson University researchers.</p>

<p>"For homeless teens, especially young women, being sexually abused as children may make these young people think sex is a way to make someone like them. As a result they are more likely to start having sex at an earlier age," Trevor Hart, an associate professor of psychology and director of Ryerson's HIV Prevention Lab, said in a university news release.</p>

<p>The study also found that two-thirds of the homeless youth had unprotected vaginal sex.</p>
<p>"By engaging in risky sex, these youth are also potentially exposing themselves to HIV/AIDS, along with a host of other sexually transmitted infections," Hart said. </p> 

<p>The findings were slated to be presented this week at the Ontario HIV Treatment Network research conference. Because the findings were presented at a medical meeting, the data and conclusions should be viewed as preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal. </p>
