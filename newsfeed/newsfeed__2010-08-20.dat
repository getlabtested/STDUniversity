<HEADLINE><![CDATA['The Pill' Works for Women of all Weights]]></HEADLINE>

<BODY><![CDATA[<p>THURSDAY, Aug. 19 (HealthDay News) -- Birth control pills are equally effective in obese and thinner women, claims a study that challenges the belief that oral contraceptives may not reliably prevent pregnancy in heavier women.</p>

<p>The study included 226 women, aged 18 to 35, who were normal weight or overweight. They were randomly assigned to take either a lower- or higher-dose version of a birth control pill.</p>

<p>After three or four months of using the pill (the time it takes for a woman's body to get used to the contraceptive), the women were checked to see if the pill was suppressing ovulation.</p>

<p>Of the 150 women who used the pill consistently, ovulation occurred in three of the 96 normal-weight women and in one of the 54 obese women. Women who were not consistent about taking the pill were more likely to ovulate, said the researchers at the New York-Presbyterian Hospital/Columbia University Medical Center.</p>

<p>"Our findings strengthen the message to patients that the pill will only work if it is taken every day. Weight does not seem to have an impact on suppression of ovulation, but consistency of pill-taking does," principal investigator Dr. Carolyn Westhoff, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology and director of the family planning division at Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, said in a medical center news release.</p>

<p>The researchers also found that the lower-dose oral contraceptive was as effective as the higher-dose type in suppressing ovulation in obese women. This is an important finding because it was previously thought that obese women might need the higher-dose version. However, obese women are at increased risk for developing blood clots from taking birth control pills, and higher-dose pills increase that risk.</p>

<p>"Knowing that the lower dose works as well as the higher dose will allow physicians to not only help women with obesity avoid unwanted pregnancies, but also protect them from the possible health risks associated with higher doses," said Westhoff, who is also an obstetrician/gynecologist at New York-Presbyterian Hospital/Columbia University Medical Center.</p>

<p>"For a woman to fear relying on her oral contraceptive to prevent pregnancy is a huge burden. This study should put those fears to rest," Westhoff said.</p>

<p>The study appears in the August issue of <i>Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology</i>.</p>

<HEADLINE><![CDATA[HIV in Blood Different Than in Semen, Scientists Say]]></HEADLINE>
<BLURB><![CDATA[More study needed to determine if finding plays a role in transmission]]></BLURB>
<BYLINE><![CDATA[]]></BYLINE>
<BODY><![CDATA[<p>THURSDAY, Aug. 19 (HealthDay News) -- HIV-1 in semen is different than HIV-1 in blood, possibly due to changes it undergoes in the genital tract, scientists have found.</p>

<p>In their study, the researchers sought to better understand the process by which HIV -- the virus that causes AIDS -- is transmitted. They compared the gene encoding the major surface protein of HIV-1 in semen and blood.</p>

<p>The team, from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, the Edward Jenner Institute for Vaccine Research in the United Kingdom and the Baylor Pediatric Center of Excellence (Malawi), published their findings in the Aug. 19 online edition of the journal <i>PLoS Pathogens</i>.</p>

<p>"In some men, the virus population in semen was similar to that in the blood, suggesting that virus was being imported from the blood into the genital tract and not being generated locally in the genital tract," study author Ronald Swanstrom said in news release from the journal's publisher.</p>

<p>"However, we found two mechanisms that significantly altered the virus population in the semen, showing that virus can grow in the seminal tract in two different ways," he added.</p>

<p>One way involves the rapid growth of one or more viruses in the seminal tract over a short period of time, resulting in a relatively similar population of HIV, compared to the complex population in blood. In the other way, HIV replicates in T-cells in the seminal tract over a long period, leading to a separate population of HIV in semen that is both complex and distinct from HIV in the blood, the study authors explained in the news release.</p>

<p>It's not known if these differences change the biology of HIV or if these changes play an important role in HIV transmission. What is clear is that HIV in the blood doesn't always represent the HIV at the site of transmission, the scientists reported.</p>
