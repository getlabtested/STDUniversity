<p>MONDAY, Aug. 30 (HealthDay News) -- College students use a number of strategies to prevent their female friends from engaging in risky sexual behavior after a night of heavy drinking, new research suggests.</p>

<p>Researchers interviewed 141 U.S. college students and found that three-quarters of them said they would persuade a female friend not to go home with a new male acquaintance or that they would make sure she arrived home safely.</p>

<p>The participants listed three ways they would attempt to ensure the safety of a female friend:</p><ul>
<li>They would remind their friend about the potential negative social and health consequences, such as getting pregnant, developing a bad reputation, and regretting their decision the next day.</li>
<li>They would distract or trick their friend by taking them to get food, or putting them in a cab to go home.</li>
<li>They would directly confront their friend, telling them that they need to leave, or if necessary, physically removing them from the situation.</li></ul>

<p>But the likelihood of students taking these actions depend on how well they know the female friend and the male acquaintance. Students are more likely to step in and protect a friend in what they deem a risky situation, but are more willing to let a female friend go home with a male acquaintance if both they and their friends know him.</p>

<p>"Our research suggests that the claim that college students routinely engage in risky sexual behavior while intoxicated may be exaggerated," Linda C. Lederman, a professor of communication at Arizona State University, said in a university news release.</p>

<p>The study was published in the July issue of the journal <i>Communication Education</i>.</p>
