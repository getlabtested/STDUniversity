<BODY><![CDATA[<p>THURSDAY, June 10 (HealthDay News) -- People who are taking care of a family member with lung cancer need support for the entire time that their loved one is terminally ill because they encounter tremendous stress during the dying process, a new study has found.</p>

<p>In many cases, the caregivers suffered from fatigue and felt as if they were also sick. The caregivers, "like patients, often felt they were on an emotional rollercoaster, experiencing peaks and troughs at key times of stress and uncertainty in the cancer trajectory," according to the report published online June 10 in <i>BMJ</i>.</p>

<p>In the study, Scott A. Murray, of the University of Edinburgh, and colleagues interviewed 19 patients with lung cancer and 19 family caregivers every three months for a one-year period, or until the patient died. While the caregivers were generally in better health than the patients, their ability to provide care was diminished when they encountered their own health problems, the investigators noted in a <i>BMJ</i> news release about the study.</p>

<p>Caregivers need support just like the people they're assisting at the four stages considered most stressful for terminally ill cancer patients: when they're diagnosed, when they're at home recovering from their initial treatment, when the cancer recurs, and when death is near, "not just in the terminal phase and during bereavement, as currently tends to be the case," the study authors concluded.</p>

<p>Caregivers may be empowered by knowing that "it is common to feel stressed and in need of support at certain times," Murray's team wrote. </p>

<HEADLINE><![CDATA[U.S. Weighs Lifting Ban on Gay Men as Blood Donors]]></HEADLINE>
<BLURB><![CDATA[Current policy out of date with advances in screening technologies, experts say]]></BLURB>
<BYLINE><![CDATA[<b>By Alan Mozes</b><br><i>HealthDay Reporter</i>]]></BYLINE>
<BODY><![CDATA[<p>FRIDAY, June 11 (HealthDay News) -- Experts at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services are midway through two days of hearings on whether a decades-old ban on gay men donating blood should stand or be lifted.</p>

<p>The current policy -- put into effect in 1985 during the early days of the AIDS crisis -- prevents any man who since 1977 has had sex with another man from donating blood.</p>

<p>In hearings that began Thursday, the Health and Human Services' Advisory Committee on Blood Safety and Availability is considering calls for a revision of the policy in light of scientific innovations made over the last 25 years. Those changes have led to marked improvements in blood screening and HIV detection, experts say.</p>

<p>Current technology, for example, allows for detection of HIV in the blood in as little as two weeks following infection.</p>

<p>"When the policy was first instigated in the 1980s there was good reason for it, based on the testing technologies we had at the time," said Chris Collins, vice president and director of public policy for the Washington, D.C.-based Foundation for AIDS Research (amFAR). "But since then, testing technology has greatly advanced in its ability to test what's in the blood. And yet our policy hasn't."</p>

<p>Many other groups agree with that view. In 2008, the American Medical Association called for ending the lifetime ban for gay men in favor of a policy that would accept blood donations from men who have sex with men -- so long as five years have elapsed since their last sexual encounter.</p>

<p>And in a policy statement issued Thursday by the American Red Cross, the organization said it believes that "the current lifetime deferral for men who have had sex with other men is unwarranted and donor deferral criteria should be modified and made comparable with criteria for other groups at increased risk for sexual transmission of transfusion-transmitted infections."</p>

<p>The Red Cross reiterated its position outlined in 2006, in a statement issued jointly with the American Association of Blood Banks and America's Blood Centers. That statement said that men who have sex with men should be allowed to donate, as long as 12 months have elapsed since their last sexual contact.</p>

<p>Various advocacy groups have echoed those sentiments. New York City-based Gay Men's Health Crisis (GMHC), along with the Human Rights Campaign, the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force, amFAR, the Hemophilia Federation of America, and the National Hemophilia Foundation issued a joint statement earlier this week pushing for a repeal of the ban.</p>

<p>They urged Health and Human Services to "recommend any scientific research that is necessary to allow for the thoughtful consideration of alternative policies regarding donor deferral."</p>

<p>U.S. Food and Drug Administration experts have estimated that the rate of HIV infection among likely gay blood donors would be 15 times higher than that of the general public.</p>
 
<p>However, experts say the science of detecting HIV in donated blood has grown considerably over the past few decades. And the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has found no evidence of any HIV transmission related to blood transfusions between 2002 and 2007.</p> 

<p>Widening donations to include gay men would greatly help the blood supply.  As reported by <i>MSNBC</i>, one recent study from the Williams Institute at the UCLA School of Law found that replacing the ban with a one-year deferral period would lead to an increase of nearly 90,000 pints of donated blood each year.</p>

<p>John Indence, vice president of marketing and communications at the National Hemophilia Foundation, said his group wants "the science to dictate the choice. We don't want it to be an emotional issue."</p>

<p>Dr. Norbert Gilmore, a professor of medicine at McGill University and an AIDS clinician in Montreal, agreed that the current policy makes little sense, but maintaining the public's faith in the safety of the blood supply is paramount.</p>

<p>"Trust is the word," he said. "The system is built on trust and runs on trust. Every donor who comes in has to tell the truth about his sexual history. And everyone who gets a donation has to believe that the blood is safe."</p>

<p>Even if tainted blood did get donated, it would most likely never make it through screening, he added.</p>

<p>"With the technology we have, the risks are so small that keeping this ban in place is like permanently grounding the entire aviation system because we're afraid that eventually we might have a single crash," he said.</p>

<p>Any decision taken by Health and Human Services would ultimately have to be approved by the FDA, which has failed to change the current policy after two reviews undertaken over the past decade.</p>

<HEADLINE><![CDATA[Men May Be More Vulnerable to Roller Coaster Ride of Romance]]></HEADLINE>
<BLURB><![CDATA[Study found young males felt ups and downs of relationships more deeply than young women]]></BLURB>
<BYLINE><![CDATA[<b>By Madonna Behen</b><br><i>HealthDay Reporter</i>]]></BYLINE>
<BODY><![CDATA[<p>FRIDAY, June 11 (HealthDay News) -- Young men are often portrayed as insensitive players with a "love 'em and leave 'em" attitude toward the opposite sex, but a new study suggests that they are actually more vulnerable to the emotional ups and downs of romantic relationships than young women.</p>

<p>"The perception is that young men are unfeeling when it comes to relationships, and that all they want is to have sex," said study author Robin Simon, a professor of sociology at Wake Forest University in Winston-Salem, N.C. "But these findings reveal that they are emotionally involved, and that they actually benefit more from the good parts of the relationship and are more harmed by the bad than women."</p>

<p>For the study, Simon and co-author Anne Barrett, an associate professor of sociology at Florida State University in Tallahassee, analyzed survey data on 1,611 men and women between the ages of 18 and 23 that had been originally gathered for a long-term study of mental health and the transition to adulthood. First, they looked at whether being in a relationship or having a recent breakup had any effect on the young adults' mental health, as well as whether there were any differences in men vs. women. Then, they examined what effect partner strain and support in an ongoing relationship had on the subjects' mental well-being, and whether there were any gender differences there.</p>

<p>Not surprisingly, Simon and Barrett found that women were more likely than men to experience depression when a relationship ended and benefited more from being part of a couple. But when the researchers looked at the effects of ongoing relationships on mental health, the tables were turned. Men received greater emotional benefits than women from the positive aspects of a romantic relationship, and they were also more likely than women to be emotionally harmed by the stress of a rocky patch.</p>

<p>Simon said young men might be more vulnerable to the ups and downs of a romance because in many cases it's their sole source of intimacy, whereas "young women are more likely to have a variety of different types of close relationships."</p>

<p>It's also possible, she said, that societal changes have led today's generation of men to become more emotionally dependent on their girlfriends. "The young men in our study came of age at a very different historical time," said Simon. "These kids had working moms and their dads often depended on that salary, so they're more likely to view marriage as a partnership."</p>

<p>Another expert agreed with the notion that men may be more vulnerable because they don't have as many close, supportive relationships as women.</p>

<p>"In our marriage education workshops, I often hear men remark that their wives are their sole source of emotional support, and it is often the husbands that express the most gratitude for the support and encouragement of other husbands, and wives, in the group," said psychologist Laura E. Frame, supervisor of the Supporting Healthy Marriage Program at Montefiore Medical Center in New York City.</p>

<p>Frame added that the findings support the idea that young people should be educated about how to establish and maintain healthy romantic partnerships. "These skills can be taught and practiced, and can go a long way in preventing or mitigating the consequences of relationship strain on mental health," she said.</p>

<p>The findings were published in the June issue of the <i>Journal of Health and Social Behavior</i>.</p>

<HEADLINE><![CDATA[After Vasectomy,  Single Test Might Give All-Clear]]></HEADLINE>
<BLURB><![CDATA[Any remaining sperm appear to be inconsequential, study finds]]></BLURB>
<BYLINE><![CDATA[]]></BYLINE>
<BODY><![CDATA[<p>FRIDAY, June 11 (HealthDay News) -- A single semen test three months after a man's vasectomy may be enough for him to get the all-clear, a new study finds.</p>

<p>Researchers analyzed semen samples from a group of men three months after they had a vasectomy and found that 51 percent of the samples contained no sperm and 45 percent contained less than 100,000 sperm that were unable to move (immotile).</p> 

<p>During a follow-up of at least a year, none of the 96 percent of cleared men reported getting a woman pregnant.</p>

<p>The study is published in the June issue of the urology journal <i>BJUI</i>.</p>

<p>"Our study clearly shows that three months after vasectomy about half of our patients were still producing sperm, albeit immotile and in very small numbers," study co-author Dr. Herman van Roijen, of the urology department at St. Elisabeth Hospital in Tilburg, the Netherlands, said in a journal news release. "However, our study also showed that the residual sperm are of no clinical consequence."</p>

<p>"Vasectomy is a minimally invasive surgical procedure that provides a widespread, reliable and relatively easy method of birth control," van Roijen said. "One of the major drawbacks is that a considerable number of men still have a few immotile sperm in their semen for a year or more. Conventional guidelines have stated that clearance can only be given to men who provide one or two sperm-free samples. The fear of legal action if pregnancy does occur has led to very conservative vasectomy protocols."</p>

<p>"However, our study -- based on guidelines issued by the Dutch Urological Association -- shows that one semen test is adequate to provide clearance in the vast majority of cases," van Roijen said.</p>
