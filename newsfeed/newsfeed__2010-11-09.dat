<p>MONDAY, Nov. 8 (HealthDay News) -- Teenage girls in the United States are more likely than boys to have unprotected sex during their first sexual experience, new research indicates.</p>

<p>The finding was a surprise to researcher Nicole Weller, an Arizona State University graduate student working on her doctoral degree in sociology.</p>

<p>"I'm looking at the interaction between sexual education and how it impacts young adolescent sexual behavior. This in particular was an interesting finding because males usually report that they are having more sex than females," Weller said in a university news release.</p>

<p>Her analysis of data from the National Survey of Family Growth also found that young people are waiting longer than in the past to have a first sexual encounter, but they are contracting sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) earlier than in the past.</p>

<p>"Fifteen- to 19-year-olds have the most sexually transmitted diseases. Even though they are waiting, they are having risky sex and not taking precautions," Weller said.</p>

<p>In addition, looking at disparities in sexual habits among different ethnic groups, the researcher found that black males and females are more likely than their peers to have unprotected sex.</p>

<p>According to Weller, it's important to provide sex education at a young age. "The younger one receives sexual education, the less likely you are to engage in risky sex," she said.</p>  

<p>But the type of sexual education provided in U.S. schools is inconsistent -- from abstinence to STD awareness, and from birth control to pregnancy awareness. "It varies in school districts and from state to state," she added.</p>

<p>Weller is scheduled to present her preliminary findings Monday at the American Public Health Association's Social Justice Meeting and Expo, held in Denver.</p>

<HEADLINE><![CDATA[HPV Vaccinations Lead to Fewer Genital Warts: Study]]></HEADLINE>
<BLURB><![CDATA[Decline only found in immunized population, researchers say]]></BLURB>
<BYLINE><![CDATA[]]></BYLINE>
<BODY><![CDATA[<!--Spanish ID: 645699 -->
<p>TUESDAY, Nov. 9 (HealthDay News) -- Cases of genital warts in Australia have decreased 59 percent in young women and 28 percent in heterosexual men since a government-funded human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination program for all females aged 12 to 26 was launched in 2007, a new study shows.</p>

<p>HPV types 6 and 11 cause 90 percent of all cases of genital warts. Both types of HPV are targeted by the HPV vaccine (Gardasil) used in the program. By 2009, 65.1 percent of eligible female Australian residents had received the vaccine.</p>

<p>In this study, researchers looked at 9,867 new cases of genital warts diagnosed between 2004 and 2009 at centers that were part of a national surveillance network.</p>

<p>Before 2007, the proportion of women and heterosexual men diagnosed with genital warts remained the same. After the vaccination program began in 2007, there was a significant decline in the number of young female Australian residents and heterosexual men diagnosed with genital warts.</p>

<p>The study appears online Nov. 8 in <i>The Lancet Infectious Diseases</i>.</p>

<p>"The decrease in frequency of genital warts in young Australian women resulting from the high coverage of HPV vaccination might provide protective effects in heterosexual men through herd immunity," study author Basil Donovan, head of the sexual health program at the National Center of HIV Epidemiology and Clinical Research at the University of New South Wales, and colleagues, said in a news release from the journal.</p> 

<p>But there was no significant decline in genital wart diagnoses among women who were older than 26 as of July 2007 or among men who have sex with men. These men do not have access to the free vaccine and are exposed to other unvaccinated men.</p>

<p>Men who have sex with men have high rates of HPV-related diseases, including anal cancer and genital warts, may increase the risk of HIV transmission. Therefore, these men should be considered in future HPV vaccination programs, the researchers said.</p>

<HEADLINE><![CDATA[OMG! Excessive Texting Tied to Risky Teen Behaviors]]></HEADLINE>
<BLURB><![CDATA[Kids who send more than 120 a day more likely to try drugs, alcohol and sex, researchers find]]></BLURB>
<BYLINE><![CDATA[]]></BYLINE>
<BODY><![CDATA[<p>TUESDAY, Nov. 9 (HealthDay News) -- Excessive texting and social networking may increase teens' risk for dangerous health behaviors, including smoking, drinking and sexual activity, a new study suggests.</p>

<p>Researchers looked at hyper-texting (sending more than 120 messages per school day) and hyper-networking (spending more than three hours a school day on social networking sites) among high school students in an urban county in the U.S. Midwest.</p>

<p>Many of the 19.8 percent of teens who reported hyper-texting were female, minority, from lower socioeconomic status and had no father at home, according to the researchers at Case Western Reserve School of Medicine in Cleveland.</p>

<p>Hyper-texters were: 40 percent more likely to have tried smoking; two times more likely to have tried alcohol; 43 percent more likely to binge-drink; 41 percent more likely to have used illicit drugs; 55 percent more likely to have been in a physical fight; nearly 3.5 times more likely to have had sex; and 90 percent more likely to have had four or more sexual partners.</p>

<p>The 11.5 percent of students who were hyper-networkers were: 62 percent more likely to have smoked cigarettes; 79 percent more likely to have tried alcohol; 69 percent more likely to be binge drinkers; 84 percent more likely to have used illicit drugs; 94 percent more likely to have been in a physical fight; 69 percent more likely to have had sex; and 60 percent more likely to have had four or more sexual partners.</p>

<p>Hyper-networking was also associated with increased likelihood of stress, depression, suicide, poor sleep, poor academics, television watching and parental permissiveness.</p>

<p>The study was to be presented Tuesday at the American Public Health Association annual meeting in Denver.</p>

<p>"The startling results of this study suggest that when left unchecked, texting and other widely popular methods of staying connected can have dangerous health effects on teenagers," lead researcher Dr. Scott Frank, director of the School of Medicine's Master of Public Health Program, said in a university news release.</p>

<p>"This should be a wake-up call for parents to not only help their children stay safe by not texting and driving, but by discouraging excessive use of the cell phone or social web sites in general," he added.</p>

<HEADLINE><![CDATA[Few Young Women Getting Cervical Cancer Vaccine]]></HEADLINE>
<BLURB><![CDATA[Study finds less than a third start the three-dose series, many fail to complete it]]></BLURB>
<BYLINE><![CDATA[<b>By Amanda Gardner</b><br><i>HealthDay Reporter</i>]]></BYLINE>
<BODY><![CDATA[<p>TUESDAY, Nov. 9 (HealthDay News) -- Few  teenage girls and young women are getting the human papillomavirus vaccine (HPV), and many of those who start the regimen fail to take all three doses, new research reveals.</p>

<p>Although studies have shown that the HPV vaccine is safe and effective against several strains of the sexually transmitted virus, just one-third of teens and young women who start the three-dose series actually finish, and almost three-quarters don't start it at all, according to research being presented this week at the American Association of Cancer Research annual meeting in Philadelphia. </p>

<p>"Women who are eligible for this vaccine and could potentially benefit aren't getting it at rates to maximally prevent cervical cancer," said study author J. Kathleen Tracy, an assistant professor of epidemiology and public health at the University of Maryland School of Medicine in Baltimore.</p>

<p>"This highlights the need for public health promotions and practice patterns to encourage vaccine uptake or at least discussion of the pros and cons," Tracy said.</p>

<p>Tracy has initiated a study to see if text messages will prompt women aged 18 to 26 to keep their follow-up appointments for subsequent doses of the vaccine.</p>

<p>According to background information in the abstract, about 30 percent of sexually active 14- to 19-year-olds are infected with HPV at any one time. Over time, persistent infection can lead to cervical cancer.</p>

<p>Two HPV vaccines are marketed in the United States. Gardasil, approved in 2006 for girls aged 9 and up, protects against four types of HPV, two of which cause about 70 percent of cervical cancers worldwide.</p>

<p>Cervarix, which covers the two strains of the virus responsible for most cases of cervical cancer, was approved in 2009.</p>

<p>The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that 11- and 12-year-old girls be targeted for the vaccine as most in this age group are not yet having sex and would therefore not have been exposed to HPV yet.</p>

<p>A 2008 survey, conducted before Cervarix was approved, found that only about half of American mothers intended to have daughters younger than 13 vaccinated against human papillomavirus (HPV), despite government guidelines suggesting the opposite.</p>

<p>These authors looked at medical records on 9,658 girls and women aged 9 through 26 who were seen at the University of Maryland Medical Center between August 2006 and August 2010. </p>

<p>Only 27.3 percent of them opted to start the vaccine.</p>

<p>And of these, 39.1 percent completed just one dose, 30.1 percent got two doses and 30.7 percent finished the series.</p>

<p>Blacks were less likely than white women to get all three doses, and women aged 18 through 26 were less likely than younger girls to complete the series.</p>

<p>Dr. Mark Wakabayashi, chief of gynecologic oncology at City of Hope Cancer Center in Duarte, Calif., thinks suspicions about vaccines in general, including a lingering concern that childhood vaccinations can cause autism, may cause some reluctance. Those fears about autism are generally considered to be unfounded.</p>

<p>The stigma surrounding sexually transmitted diseases may also be a deterrent. "There are these connotations with sexually transmitted diseases, so I think a lot of parents feel that, when you're talking about minors, everybody else should have the vaccine except their own child," said Wakabayashi, who recommends the vaccine to his patients.</p>

<p>Tracy speculated that women aged 18 to 26 may be caught up in life's transitions at that point, like leaving home and going to college. For many young women, this is the first time they are making their own medical decisions. </p>

<p>As for the younger age group, parents also get busy or may be less enthusiastic about a second dose if there was a side effect, such as pain at the injection site or fainting, after the first shot, she speculated. </p>

<p>Recent research from the University of Minnesota School of Public Health, which was  published in the journal <i>Health Affairs</i>, also found that ongoing  news reports regarding mandatory vaccination of middle-school students diminished support for the policy. </p>
