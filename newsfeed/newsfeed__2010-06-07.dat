<HEADLINE><![CDATA['Sleep Sex' Might Be Nightmare for Some]]></HEADLINE>
<BLURB><![CDATA[Almost 8 percent of patients at a sleep clinic reported sexsomnia, study finds]]></BLURB>

<BODY><![CDATA[<p>MONDAY, June 7 (HealthDay News) -- 
Sexsomnia -- having sex while asleep -- is a common complaint of patients seeking treatment for sleep disorders, new research shows.</p>
 
<p>Nearly 8 percent of patients referred to a sleep disorders clinic reported they had initiated or taken part in sexual behavior while sleeping. Men accounted for three-quarters of the self-reported sexsomniacs.</p>

<p>"We were surprised at how common it was," said study author Sharon A. Chung, a staff scientist in the Sleep Research Laboratory at the University Health Network in Toronto. "We thought we'd get just a handful of people, yet it was almost one in twelve."</p>
 
<p>The research was to be presented Monday at SLEEP 2010, the annual meeting of the Associated Professional Sleep Societies, in San Antonio.</p>

<p>In the study, researchers asked 832 patients about sexual behavior while sleeping, which can range from masturbation to intercourse. About 11 percent of men and 4 percent of women said they had engaged in "sleep sex."</p>

<p>Researchers said the prevalence is probably lower in the general population.</p>

<p>Sexsomnia is a form of a sleep disorder called parasomnia, or unwanted behavior that occurs during sleep. "An act of parasomnia can be as small as opening your eyes while fast asleep or grinding your teeth, to getting up and vacuuming, speaking, eating or having sex," Chung said.</p> 

<p>Generally, people have no awareness of what they are doing and no recollection of it, Chung said.</p> 

<p>Sexsomnia is more than a medical curiosity. It has been used as a criminal defense in sexual assault cases. In 2008, a Toronto man was found not guilty of sexually assaulting a woman after the court heard evidence that the man had engaged in "sleep sex"  with several former girlfriends, according to news reports.</p> 

<p>Colin Shapiro, the senior author of the paper, was an expert witness in that case, Chung noted, which got the team wondering just how common sexsomnia really was.</p>

<p>What brings on sexsomnia isn't really understood, but about twice as many patients who reported sexsomnia had used illegal drugs (15.9 percent vs. 7.7 percent) and were more likely to have consumed alcohol (41 percent vs. 27 percent). People who had experienced sexsomnia reported problems with insomnia (falling or staying asleep), fatigue and depression, although no more so than other patients at the sleep clinic. Rates of caffeine consumption and smoking were also similar, according to the study.</p>

<p>People experiencing a parasomnia are not often violent; they usually pose more of a threat to themselves, said Dr. Lisa Shives, medical director of Northshore Sleep Medicine in Evanston, Ill. But there are rare cases in which people have killed someone and claimed they were sleeping and unaware of their actions.</p>
 
<p>The good news is that parasomnia, sexsomnia included, is treatable with medications including benzodiazepines, such as clonazepam, which is also used to treat epilepsy and anxiety disorders, Shives said.</p>

<p>Yet few patients bring the issue up with the doctors. In the study, only four said they had previously told a medical professional about sexsomnia.</p> 

<p>"Of the thousands of patients I've seen, I've never had someone come in complaining of sexsomnia, but I have always believed it's a bona fide disorder," Shives said. "It's a form of sleep walking. When people are sleep walking, they may do any rote or instinctual behavior. That can include walking, eating, driving and sexual activity."</p>

<p>The reason patients don't bring it up could be embarrassment, the fact that doctors rarely ask about it, or that patients aren't particularly bothered by it, Chung said.</p>

<p>"Is it a problem? As long as you don't get into legal problems and as long as your partner doesn't mind, it's not a problem," Chung said. "Although it can leave you tired the next day."</p>

<HEADLINE><![CDATA[Kids With Lesbian Parents Do Just Fine]]></HEADLINE>
<BLURB><![CDATA[Study shows they might even be better adjusted than kids from traditional families]]></BLURB>
<BYLINE><![CDATA[<b>By Serena Gordon</b><br><i>HealthDay Reporter</i>]]></BYLINE>
<BODY><![CDATA[<p>MONDAY, June 7 (HealthDay News) --  When compared to teens of the same age, adolescents raised by lesbian parents are doing just fine socially, psychologically and academically, new research finds.</p>

<p>Not only that, they have fewer social problems, and less aggressive and rule-breaking behaviors than other teens.</p>

<p>The nearly 20-year study has followed 78 teens since their lesbian mothers were planning their pregnancies, and concluded that these children "demonstrate healthy psychological adjustment." These findings stand in contrast to what some vocal opponents of gay or lesbian parents might have expected.</p>

<p>"One of the things that opponents of the equalities of gays and lesbians -- in marriage, parenting, adoption and foster care -- often bring up is the so-called gold standard of parenting, which defined by them is the traditional family where children are conceived in traditional ways and not through insemination or surrogates. But, when we compared the adolescents in our study to the so-called gold standard, we found the teens with lesbian mothers were actually doing better," said study author Dr. Nanette Gartrell, the Williams Distinguished Scholar at the University of California Los Angeles School of Law.</p>

<p>As to why these teens are doing better, Gartrell said, "Moms in the lesbian family are very committed, very involved parents."</p>

<p>Gartrell said she expects that these findings would also translate to the children of gay male parents as well. "Gay male parents are another group of very committed parents, and really, [among gay male couples] only economically privileged gay men have access to the opportunity to become parents right now," she said.</p>

<p>Family therapist Andrew Roffman, at the New York University Langone Medical Center, wasn't surprised by the findings and agreed that such results would likely be similar for gay male parents.</p>

<p>"Good parenting makes for healthier children, regardless of your sexual orientation. Whether you're gay, straight or lesbian, good parenting is good parenting," said Roffman. </p>

<p>Results of Gartrell's study will be published in the July issue of <i>Pediatrics</i>.</p>

<p>Between 1986 and 1992, Gartrell and her colleague, Henry Bos, recruited 154 prospective lesbian mothers as they were considering artificial insemination, or once they were already pregnant.</p>

<p>As the children have grown, the researchers have been periodically checking in on them, and the latest follow-up included questionnaires completed by 78 children when they were 10 and again when they were 17. The study also included an interview with one of each child's mothers to assess the child's psychological well-being. </p>

<p>The results were then compared to a group of age-matched children from traditional families. </p>

<p>Compared to the traditionally reared teens, adolescents with lesbian parents rated significantly higher in social, academic and total competence, according to the study. The teens with lesbian parents also rated significantly lower when it came to social problems, rule-breaking and aggressive behavior than teens raised in more traditional families.</p>

<p>Even in homes where the lesbian parents had split up, the researchers found that those teens still fared better than teens from more traditional families.</p>

<p>Just over four in 10 of the teens raised by lesbian parents reported that they had been stigmatized at some point because of their parents' sexual orientation, said Gartrell. But, when the researchers compared those who had been stigmatized to those who hadn't, they found no significant psychological differences. </p>

<p>"These young people seem to have done well; they have some resilience," she said. </p>

<p>Roffman said there's likely a resilience factor at play. And, he said, it may come from the lesbian parents thinking ahead of time about what the child's experiences might be and talking with the children before anything happens.</p>

<p>"Probably the most effective thing to do is to prepare kids ahead of time. Let them know that there is still a cultural stigma and that they may encounter children and adults who are insensitive. Having these kinds of talks is relationship-building for both parents and children," said Roffman </p>

<p>"The outcomes here were very clear. These are families in which the mothers were very committed, involved and loving. The 17-year-old adolescents are healthy, happy and high-functioning," said Gartrell. </p>

<HEADLINE><![CDATA[Mouth Cancer Prognosis Improves When Cervical Cancer Virus Involved]]></HEADLINE>
<BLURB><![CDATA[Finding HPV in tumor meant lower death rates in those with cancer at back of the mouth, study finds]]></BLURB>
<BYLINE><![CDATA[]]></BYLINE>
<BODY><![CDATA[<p>MONDAY, June 7 (HealthDay News) -- For patients battling a type of cancer that affects the back of the mouth, the chances of survival increase if the tumor contains the sexually transmitted virus that causes cervical cancer, new research shows.</p>

<p>In fact, the presence of human papillomavirus (HPV) is the most important predictor of survival in oropharyngeal cancer, researchers from the Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center-Arthur G. James Cancer Hospital and Richard J. Solove Research Institute (OSUCCC-James) found.</p>

<p>"Previous studies indicated a relationship existed between the presence or absence of HPV in oropharyngeal tumors and patient survival, but they couldn't determine if other favorable factors present in these patients were responsible for their better outcome," lead author Dr. Maura Gillison, an OSUCCC-James medical oncologist and head and neck cancer specialist, said in a news release.</p>

<p>"These findings close the door on these questions," Gillison added, "and will allow the field to move forward with clinical trials designed to determine how we should use molecular and behavioral factors to personalize therapy for patients."</p>

<p>The report was published online June 7 in the <i>New England Journal of Medicine</i>, to coincide with presentation of the findings Monday at the American Society of Clinical Oncology annual meeting, in Chicago.</p>

<p>The authors noted that a patient's lifetime smoking history was the second leading predictor of survival for this particular form of cancer.</p>

<p>The finding stems from a three-year post-treatment analysis of tumors and survival rates among 323 patients diagnosed with stage 3 or stage 4 oropharyngeal cancer, among whom 206 had HPV-positive tumors while 117 had HPV-negative tumors.</p>

<p>More than 80 percent of those with HPV-positive tumors remained alive three years after treatment, the authors found, while the same was true for just 57 percent of those with HPV-negative tumors.</p>

<p>Other potential factors -- such as being younger, being white, having more energy, lacking anemia, and/or having a smaller tumor size -- accounted for just 10 percent of the survival rate differences, the team concluded.</p>

<p>On the other hand, smoking did register as a serious risk factor for poor survival chances, for both HPV-positive and HPV-negative patients, the study found. In fact, the risk for dying from the disease or experiencing a relapse rose 1 percent for every year that patients had smoked one pack per day.</p>

<p>The study authors said more research is needed before being able to discern exactly how doctors might best make use of such survival factor information when designing a patient's treatment plan. However, knowing a patient's HPV status and smoking history should be considered central --alongside knowing what stage the patient's cancer is at -- to any decision-making process regarding which treatment strategy to utilize and how aggressively it should be administered, the authors noted.</p>
