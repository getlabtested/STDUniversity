<p>MONDAY, May 17 (HealthDay News) -- Vaccination with the smallpox vaccine called "vaccinia" may boost a person's ability to resist infection with HIV, new research suggests.</p>

<p>If true, the finding could link the rapid, late 20th-century spread of HIV to the simultaneous vanquishing of smallpox disease and the removal of the smallpox vaccine -- and possible HIV firewall-- from worldwide distribution.</p>

<p>The notion stems from recent work by researchers at the University of California, Los Angeles, and George Mason University in Manassas, Va. The findings were published May 17 in <i>BMC Immunology</i>.</p>

<p>"There have been several proposed explanations for the rapid spread of HIV in Africa," Dr. Raymond Weinstein of George Mason U. said in a news release. These include "wars, the reuse of unsterilized needles and the contamination of early batches of polio vaccine," he said.</p>

<p>"However, all of these have been either disproved or do not sufficiently explain the behavior of the HIV pandemic," he said. "Our finding that prior immunization with vaccinia virus may provide an individual with some degree of protection to subsequent HIV infection suggests that the withdrawal of such vaccination may be a partial explanation."</p>

<p>The study authors noted that the vaccine for smallpox was gradually removed from use between the 1950s and the 1970s, following global elimination of the disease.</p>

<p>They point out that HIV began spreading faster in more or less the same time frame.</p>

<p>To get a closer look at how the two occurrences might be associated, Weinstein and his colleagues analyzed the behavior of white blood cells sampled from patients recently immunized with the smallpox vaccine.</p>

<p>They found that after exposure to HIV, cells from immunized individuals were five times less likely to allow for HIV replication than the same cells taken from non-immunized patients.</p>

<p>The research team theorized that administration of the smallpox vaccine might trigger long-term changes in the immune system that guard against HIV infection. They further highlighted a certain receptor on the surface of white blood cells -- called "CCR5" -- as one possible target of such a beneficial change.</p>

<p>"While these results are very interesting and hopefully may lead to a new weapon against the HIV pandemic, they are very preliminary and it is far too soon to recommend the general use of vaccinia immunization for fighting HIV," said Weinstein.</p>

<BODY><![CDATA[<p>TUESDAY, May 18 (HealthDay News) -- Surgical residents are more likely to plan for specialty fellowships if they're single or childless, a new study finds.</p>

<p>"Specialization is a growing trend that might jeopardize the future of general surgery," the study authors wrote. "Research has demonstrated that it likely results from multiple factors, including the changing demographics of medical schools and surgery residency programs, residency type [academic vs. community setting] and early exposure through research performed during residency."</p>
 
<p>Dr. Kate V. Viola, of the Yale School of Medicine, and colleagues surveyed 4,586 general surgery residents in 2008 and asked them about their career plans and opinions on specialization.</p>

<p>Slightly more than half of the respondents said they were married, and another 24 percent reported being in a relationship. About a quarter of all the respondents said they had kids.</p>

<p>Overall, 68 percent of the residents were men, and all respondents had an average age of 31.</p>

<p>Fifty-five percent said they thought a general surgeon needs to be trained in a specialty to be successful, and 78 percent said they thought specialty training would lead to a higher income.</p>

<p>Fifty-seven percent of those without kids said they planned for a specialty fellowship, vs. 50 percent of those with kids. Single residents were also more likely than married ones to plan for a fellowship.</p>

<p>"This study raises interesting questions regarding trainees' beliefs and intent to seek specialty training," the authors wrote. "Each fellowship experience is unique and provides varying potential for income and lifestyle flexibility. More research is needed to stratify resident characteristics associated with considering post-residency training and the impact of marriage and children on the rigors of residency and fellowship."</p>

<p>The study is published in the May issue of the <i>Archives of Surgery</i>.</p>

<HEADLINE><![CDATA[Antibiotic Resistance Can Last a Year, Review Finds]]></HEADLINE>
<BLURB><![CDATA[Experts urge more careful use of the drugs in primary care]]></BLURB>
<BYLINE><![CDATA[]]></BYLINE>
<BODY><![CDATA[<p>TUESDAY, May 18 (HealthDay News) -- Some patients who take antibiotics may become resistant to them and stay that way for as long as a year, a new review finds.</p>

<p>The researchers analyzed 24 studies of antibiotic resistance, in which people develop a partial or full immunity to the powers of a medication. The studies looked at use of the drugs in primary care, most often for respiratory or urinary tract infections.</p>

<p>Antibiotic resistance is at its height in the month after a drug is prescribed, but the effect may last for a year, according to the findings published online May 18 in <i>BMJ</i>. </p>

<p>"Primary care clinicians and patients may wish to consider this evidence when discussing the benefits and risks of prescribing and consuming antibiotics," study author Alastair Hay, consultant senior
lecturer in primary health care at the University of Bristol in England, and colleagues concluded.</p>

<p>In an accompanying commentary, two economics and health policy specialists wrote that new drugs are needed to help combat the antibiotic resistance problem.</p>

<p>Another commentary warns that "nothing less than the future of medicine, from organ transplants to chemotherapy, is at stake, and there will be no second chances."</p>
