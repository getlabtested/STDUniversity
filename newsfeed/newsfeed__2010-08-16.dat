<p>MONDAY, Aug. 16 (HealthDay News) -- Folks with Internet connections are more likely to be in a romantic relationship than folks without access to the Web, a new study shows.</p>

<p>And it's likely that the Web will soon replace the old standby, "friends," as the number one way to meet your soul mate, Stanford researchers were to report Monday at the American Sociological Association annual meeting in Atlanta.</p>

<p>Virtual connections are proving especially fruitful for lonely hearts from minority or tough-to-find-a-good-mate segments, such as middle-aged heterosexuals and gays and lesbians. </p>

<p>"We're seeing this as a trend now as more generations are embracing the Internet, and with competing demands on people's schedules, this seems like the next logical step," said Simon Rego, director of clinical training at the American Institute for Cognitive Therapy in New York City.</p>

<p>"Clinically, I've certainly seen an increase in the people utilizing the Web, and this study validates that," said Theresa Quinn, an assistant professor of psychiatry and behavioral science at Texas A&amp;M Health Science Center College of Medicine and director of psychology at Scott &amp; White College Station Clinic. "I think it's more pervasive than people expected."</p>

<p>In 1940, 20 percent of people were introduced to their mate by friends, with that number reaching 40 percent in 1990.</p>

<p>Now that trend is in decline, as are other local ways of meeting people, such as community groups, school ties or co-workers, the study authors stated.</p>

<p>The researchers drew their conclusions from a nationally representative survey called How Couples Meet and Stay Together. The survey also included in-depth interviews with participants. </p>

<p>More than 80 percent of people surveyed who had an Internet connection at home were coupled up (either married or living with a domestic partner). For adults without Internet access, the rate was 62.8 percent. </p>

<p>Three-quarters of partners in couples that met on the Internet had had no idea that a mate was waiting in cyberspace. In other words, they had had no non-virtual contact beforehand.</p>

<p>Online venues most often cited as good meeting places were Web dating sites, virtual classifieds, chat rooms, social networking Web sites (such as Facebook or MySpace) and through Internet games.</p>

<p>There appeared to be another advantage to meeting online: Breakup rates were higher among couples who had met the old-fashioned way, through friends -- 9.6 percent vs. 8.1 percent who had met through other means.</p>

<p>Groups that previously had little hope are also now finding their odds greatly heightened.</p>

<p>"What's particularly intriguing is the notion that for select groups that may have been marginalized in the past, [this provides] great opportunities to connect to people which may not have been readily available in traditional methods [such as] friends or gay clubs," Rego said. </p>

<p>The study describes one lesbian woman in the South who started meeting people in her ZIP code using America Online (now called AOL). Previous forays into a gay bar and a gay church had been fruitless. </p>

<p>The same holds true for the older set. </p>

<p>"I have a lot of people in the 30-to-40 age range who are either separated or divorced or had put their career first and suddenly they realized the friendship networks that they would typically have used have dried up because those friends are married or forming families and so don't go out as frequently," Rego said. "Now you've got this whole medium where potentially millions of people come together."  </p>

<p>Quinn is also seeing more middle-aged heterosexual singles meeting over the Internet, as well as gay and lesbians. </p>

<p>"The message of it is clear. This trend is happening and it seems logical," Rego said. "I imagine that this will continue to grow as people grow into the Internet and embrace it."</p>

<HEADLINE><![CDATA[Infidelity Rises When She Makes More Than He Does]]></HEADLINE>
<BLURB><![CDATA[In such couples, 'gender identity threat' may make men less faithful, study suggests]]></BLURB>
<BYLINE><![CDATA[<b>By Randy Dotinga</b><br><i>HealthDay Reporter</i>]]></BYLINE>
<BODY><![CDATA[<!--Spanish ID: 642188 -->
<p>MONDAY, Aug. 16 (HealthDay News) -- A new study finds that men are more likely to cheat if their income is much lower than what their wife or female partner makes, while women are more likely to fool around if they make more than their husband or male partner.</p>

<p>The findings suggest that disparities in moneymaking play a significant role in infidelity, at least among the young couples they studied.</p>

<p>"With women, they were less likely to engage in infidelity the less money they make relative to their husband," said study author Christin Munsch. "But for men, the less money you make relative to your spouse, the more likely you are to engage in infidelity."</p>

<p>Munsch, a graduate student at Cornell University, said she came up with the idea of studying the effects of income on infidelity after hearing from a friend who has cheated on his partner. He told Munsch that "she made all the money, she had all the friends, and he'd moved up there to be with her. He felt completely powerless."</p>

<p>While there's been previous research into infidelity, it didn't look into differences in income among couples, Munsch said.</p>

<p>So she examined the results of a national survey that tracked 9,000 people beginning in 1997 when they were children. She focused on the results of the survey from 2001-2007, when the participants were between 17 and 27 years old. </p>

<p>The findings are scheduled to be released Monday at the American Sociological Association annual meeting in Atlanta.</p>

<p>Munsch found that almost 7 percent of the men reported having sex outside their relationships between 2002 and 2007, while about 3 percent of women did. Black and Hispanic men were more likely than white men to have fooled around.</p>

<p>Two lifestyle factors, higher education and regular religious observance, seem to help keep infidelity at bay for both men and women, the study found.</p>

<p>But factors having to do with money -- such as the man making more or less than his wife or female partner -- did increase the risk of infidelity, Munsch said. But she cautioned that "we're talking about very small numbers."</p>

<p>If you're a woman and "you make more money than your partner, your partner isn't 100 percent likely to cheat," she stressed.</p>

<p>Still, money appeared to be a significant factor.</p>

<p>Men who make less than their wives may lean toward infidelity because they feel a "gender identity threat," Munsch speculated.</p>

<p>"The range of acceptable behaviors for men is a lot narrower" when it comes to dynamics in a relationship, such as those involving finances, she said. "It's harder to hit that mark because it's a smaller mark. If you're not hitting the mark, you might feel threatened."</p>

<p>On the other end of the spectrum, infidelity seemed to rise when one partner made a <i>lot</i> more money than the other. And that held true whether the man or the woman was the big wage earner.</p>

<p>"If you work long hours and have more disposable income, it's easier to hide infidelity," Munsch reasoned.  For example, unusual expenses charged to credit cards might go unnoticed. Also, she said, people who make more money may also travel frequently and meet lots of people of the opposite sex.</p> 

<p>Helen Fisher, an anthropologist and research professor at Rutgers University, said it makes sense that men with more money would be more likely to fool around.</p> 

<p>"He probably travels a lot and drives nicer cars, and he's probably in finer restaurants. He's advertising the kind of resources that women are looking for from an evolutionary perspective," she said. "Around the world, women go for men who are on the top of the pile."</p>

<p>But there's less reason, from an evolutionary perspective, for a man to stray if he makes less money than his female partner, she said. "You'd think a man would want to stick around those resources himself. That may have more of a purely psychological explanation."</p>

<p>As for women, she said, wealth brings them a greater power to do what they want, whether it's leave a bad relationship or have an affair.</p>

<BODY><![CDATA[<p>MONDAY, Aug. 16 (HealthDay News) -- The ella emergency contraceptive has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. It's been available in Europe for more than a year under the brand name ellaOne.</p>

<p>To be taken within five days of contraceptive failure or unprotected intercourse, the drug is not meant to be used as a routine contraceptive, the FDA said in news release. Among a class of drugs called progesterone agonists/antagonists, it's intended to inhibit or delay ovulation.</p>

<p>Ella's safety and effectiveness were demonstrated in studies conducted in the United States, United Kingdom and Ireland, the agency said. The most common side effects included headache, nausea, abdominal pain, menstrual pain, fatigue and dizziness.</p>

<p>Women with known or suspected pregnancy or those who are breast-feeding shouldn't use ella, the FDA said.</p>

<p>The drug is distributed by Watson Pharma Inc., based in Morristown, N.J.</p>
