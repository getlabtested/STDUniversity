<BODY><![CDATA[<p>SATURDAY, Oct. 30 (HealthDay News) -- Hepatitis C patients who receive a liver from a white donor have significantly more aggressive recurrent hepatitis than those who receive a liver from a black donor, researchers have found.</p>

<p>This is especially true for black patients who receive a liver from a white donor, the study authors noted.</p>

<p>Researchers from Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit looked at 165 hepatitis C patients who received a liver transplant at the hospital between 2000 and 2006. The patients were given a recurrent hepatitis C virus (HCV) score between 1 and 3.</p>

<p>The average recurrent HCV score for patients for each donor/recipient race combination was:</p><ul>
<li>White donor/white recipient: 1.54</li>
<li>White donor/black recipient: 1.89</li>
<li>Black donor/white recipient: 1.18</li>
<li>Black donor/black recipient: 1.23</li></ul>

<p>"The data suggests a graft from a white donor is potentially one more important variable in identifying patients at risk for more aggressive recurrent hepatitis after transplant and warrants further study," lead author Dr. Matthew Moeller, a gastroenterology fellow, said in a hospital news release.</p>

<p>The study findings were slated to be presented Oct. 29 at the annual meeting of the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases, in Boston.</p>

<p>According to data from the United Network for Organ Sharing cited in the news release, there are almost 18,000 Americans on the waiting list for liver transplants.</p>
