<HEADLINE><![CDATA[HIV Patients Do Well After Kidney Transplants: Study]]></HEADLINE>
<BLURB><![CDATA[But their bodies are more likely to reject organs in long run, researchers say]]></BLURB>
<BYLINE><![CDATA[<b>By Randy Dotinga</b><br><i>HealthDay Reporter</i>]]></BYLINE>
<BODY><![CDATA[<p>THURSDAY, Nov. 18 (HealthDay News) -- A large, new study provides more evidence that people infected with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, do almost as well on the survival front as other patients when they undergo kidney transplants.</p>

<p>Up until the mid-1990s, physicians tended to avoid giving kidney transplants to HIV patients because of fear that AIDS would quickly kill them. Since then, new medications have greatly lengthened life spans for HIV patients, and surgeons routinely perform kidney transplants on them in some urban hospitals.</p>

<p>The study authors, led by Dr. Peter G. Stock, a professor of surgery at the University of California, San Francisco, examined the medical records of 150 HIV-infected patients who underwent kidney transplantation between 2003 and 2009. They report their findings in the Nov. 18 issue of the <i>New England Journal of Medicine</i>.</p>

<p>The researchers found that about 95 percent of the transplant patients lived for one year and about 88 percent lived for three years. Those survival rates fall between those for kidney transplant patients in general and those who are aged 65 and over.</p>

<p>"They live just as long as the other patients we consider for transplantation. They're essentially the same as the rest of our patients," said transplant specialist Dr. Silas P. Norman, an assistant professor of internal medicine at the University of Michigan. Norman was not part of the study team.</p>

<p>There was one troubling finding: the bodies of HIV patients were more likely to reject the kidneys than the bodies of other transplant patients. It's likely that surgeons will need to better tailor their procedures to help prevent organ rejection, said transplant surgeon Dr. Dorry Segev. This should happen as surgeons gain more experience with transplants in HIV patients, said Segev, an associate professor of surgery and epidemiology at Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions, who was familiar with the study findings.</p>

<p>Overall, Segev said, "treatment of HIV-infected patients undergoing kidney transplantation is clearly not straightforward, and this study has identified some challenges for the transplant community to address."</p>

<p>On the bright side, transplant procedures didn't appear to have much of an impact on the HIV infections in the patients.</p>

<p>In years past, Norman said, transplant surgeons worried about how the AIDS virus would interact with the medications given to transplant patients that are designed to dampen the immune system. The concern was that "these patients are now doing well, and you're going to give them medicine and undo all their benefits," he said.</p>

<p>But it turns out that transplantation drugs have the opposite effect and often suppress the AIDS virus, he said. This is because HIV revs up the immune system while the drugs turn it down, he explained.</p>

<p>Norman said he expects that the new findings will encourage more surgeons to perform kidney transplants on HIV patients, who are frequently surviving long enough to develop diseases that typically target older people.</p>

<p>"There are still a lot of people in the community, including  transplant professionals, nephrologists and infectious disease professionals, who still don't appreciate that many of these patients  are good prospects for transplantation," Norman said. "They don't appreciate how many procedures have been done to date, and how we're getting overall very good outcomes."</p>

<HEADLINE><![CDATA[Smarten Up About Antibiotics, CDC Urges]]></HEADLINE>
<BLURB><![CDATA[Knowing when to use, refuse can help prevent deadly 'superbugs']]></BLURB>
<BYLINE><![CDATA[<b>By Julia VanTine</b><br><i>HealthDay Reporter</i>]]></BYLINE>
<BODY><![CDATA[<p>THURSDAY, Nov. 18 (HealthDay News) -- Knowing when to take antibiotics -- and when not to -- can help fight the rise of deadly "superbugs," say experts at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. </p>

<p>About half of antibiotics prescribed are unnecessary or inappropriate, the agency says, and overuse has helped create bacteria that don't respond, or respond less effectively, to the drugs used to fight them. </p>

<p>"Antibiotics are a shared resource that has become a scarce resource," said Dr. Lauri Hicks, a medical epidemiologist at the CDC. She's also  medical director a of new program, <i>Get Smart: Know When Antibiotics Work</i>, that had its launch this week. "Everyone has a role to play in preventing the spread of antibiotic resistance," Hicks said.</p>

<p>The stakes are high, said Dr. Arjun Srinivasan, CDC's associate director for health care-associated infection prevention programs. Almost every type of bacteria has become stronger and less responsive to antibiotic treatment, he said. </p>

<p>The CDC is urging Americans to use the drugs properly to help prevent the global problem of antibiotic resistance. To that end, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), numerous national medical and scientific associations, as well as state and local health departments have collaborated on the CDC's <i>Get Smart</i> initiative.</p>

<p>Most strains of antibiotic-resistant bacteria are still found in health care settings, such as hospitals and nursing homes. Yet superbugs, including MRSA (methicillin-resistant <i> staphylococcus aureus</i>) -- which kills about 19,000 Americans a year -- are increasingly found in community settings, such as health clubs, schools, and workplaces, said Hicks. </p>

<p> Community-associated MRSA (CA-MRSA), a strain that affects healthy people outside of hospitals, made headlines in 2008, when it killed a Florida high school football player. </p>

<p>Referring to recent reports of sinusitis caused by MRSA, Hicks said that "people who would normally be treated with an oral antibiotic are requiring more toxic medications or, in some instances, admission to a hospital. We've seen this with pneumonia, too, and I worry we'll start to see it with other types of infections as well." </p>

<p> Other infections that resist antibiotic treatment include: </p><ul>

<li><b>E. coli</b>. A new strain, ST131, was a major cause of serious resistant infections in the United States in 2007, a study published this year in <i> Clinical Infectious Diseases</i> found. If the strain gains one more resistance gene, the study said, it may become almost untreatable. </li>
<li><b>Gonorrhea</b>. Only one last class of antibiotics -- cephalosporin--is recommended to treat this sexually transmitted disease. </li>

<li><b>XDR-TB</b> (extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis). While many TB strains  resist at least one antibiotic used to treat them, XDR-TB is resistant to virtually all of them. </li>
</ul>

<p>Just as antibiotic resistance is rising, the antibiotic arsenal is shrinking. The FDA has approved just 10 new antibiotics since 1998. "But in our opinion, it's as important to improve [antibiotic] use as it is to develop new drugs," said Srinivasan. </p>

<p>Antibiotic resistance has two main causes, said Philip Tierno, director of clinical microbiology and immunology at New York University's Langone Medical Center. The first is overprescribing.</p>

<p>"About six billion prescriptions are written annually in this country, about half of them for antibiotics," he said. "Of those written for antibiotics, the CDC thinks about half are improper." </p>

<p>Second, food animals such as chickens, cattle and hogs are given massive amounts of antibiotics, mainly to spur growth. "Of the 25 million pounds of antibiotics given to livestock per year, only three million pounds are given to treat disease," said Tierno. Earlier this year, concerns about antibiotic resistance led the FDA to recommend that farmers stop using antibiotics to promote growth in livestock.</p>

<p>To protect antibiotics' effectiveness, the CDC recommends the following:</p><ul>

<li>Take the antibiotic exactly as prescribed, and finish it even if you start to feel better. That way, bacteria can't survive and re-infect you.</li> 

<li>Throw out leftover antibiotics.</li>

<li>Don't ask your doctor for an antibiotic if you have a cold or the flu. They're caused by viruses, so antibiotics won't help. </li>

<li>If you think you have strep throat, ask to be tested. Only a test can tell if your sore throat is caused by a bacterial infection and thus requires an antibiotic. </li> 

<li>Don't take an antibiotic prescribed for someone else. Taking the wrong medicine may delay the right treatment and allow bacteria to multiply. </li> 

<li>If your child has an ear infection, watch and wait. This method is the best way to treat childhood ear infections, which are often caused by a virus, according to a new study published this week the <i> Journal of the American Medical Association </i>.</li></ul>

<HEADLINE><![CDATA[Did Ex-Girlfriend's Facebook Page Trigger Man's Asthma?]]></HEADLINE>
<BLURB><![CDATA[Italian doctors say every time jilted beau logged on, breathing troubles began]]></BLURB>
<BYLINE><![CDATA[]]></BYLINE>
<BODY><![CDATA[<p>THURSDAY, Nov. 18 (HealthDay News) -- Social networking might have triggered asthma attacks for one young Italian man, who experienced breathing troubles whenever he accessed an ex-girlfriend's Facebook page.</p>

<p>Doctors are reporting the strange case in the Nov. 20 edition of <i>The Lancet</i>.</p>

<p>The 18-year-old man was depressed because his girlfriend had dumped him and also deleted him from her list of Facebook friends, while "friending" many new young men, the doctors explained in a letter to the journal.</p>

<p>The man, who was taking medications to control his asthma, used a new Facebook nickname to become the girl's friend again and see her picture on her Facebook profile. But every time he saw her picture, he suffered shortness of breath.</p>

<p>"The [man's] mother was advised to ask him to measure the peak expiratory [lung] flow before and after Internet login and, indeed, post-Facebook values were reduced, with a variability of more than 20 percent," write Dr. Gennaro D'Amato, of the High Specialty Hospital A Carderelli in Naples, and colleagues. "In collaboration with a psychiatrist, the patient resigned not to login to Facebook any longer and the asthma attacks stopped."</p>

<p>After taking the man's medical history and giving him a thorough physical examination, the doctors discounted other possible environmental and infectious factors and concluded that seeing his ex-girlfriend's Facebook page triggered the man's asthma attacks.</p>

<p>"This case indicates that Facebook, and social networks in general, could be a new source of psychological stress, representing a triggering factor for exacerbations in depressed asthmatic individuals," the doctors wrote. "Considering the high prevalence of asthma, especially among young people, we suggest that this type of trigger be considered in the assessment of asthma exacerbations."</p>
