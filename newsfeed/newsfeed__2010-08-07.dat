<HEADLINE><![CDATA[Narcissistic Men Typically Direct Their Rage at Straight Women]]></HEADLINE>

<BODY><![CDATA[<p>FRIDAY, Aug. 6 (HealthDay News) -- Ever met a guy who talks only about himself, thinks he's superior to everyone and who tends to view women as little more than playthings?</p>

<p>That man may very well have narcissistic personality disorder, a condition marked by an inflated sense of self-importance and a profound lack of empathy for others.</p>

<p>And new research suggests the anger, hostility and short fuse that accompany a man's narcissism tend to be directed toward straight women.</p>

<p>"Heterosexual, narcissistic men become enraged at people who deny them gratification, whether it's social status, having a trophy partner or sexual gratification," said lead study author Scott Keiller, a clinical psychologist and assistant professor of psychology at Kent State University Tuscarawas in Ohio. </p>
<p>"The group that could gratify heterosexual men the most is heterosexual women," Keiller said. "To the extent narcissistic men would get resistance, that would make them enraged."</p>

<p>For the study, published online July 23 in the journal <i>Sex Roles</i>, Keiller and his colleagues gave 104 male undergraduates questionnaires designed to measure narcissism.  Questions included: "I love to be the center of attention" or "It embarrasses me when I am the center of attention." The former is associated with narcissism, the latter with modesty and humility. </p>

<p>They were also asked about their attitudes toward gay men, lesbians, straight women and other straight men, including how much they ascribed to traditional -- some would say sexist -- male and female stereotypes.</p>
<p>None of the men questioned had diagnosable narcissistic personality disorder, said Keiller. (The disorder is diagnosed when one meets five symptoms on a list that includes grandiosity, a strong sense of entitlement, and an overwhelming need for admiration, according to the American Psychiatric Association.) But narcissism is a continuum, and plenty of the young men had a pronounced tendency toward those traits, he said.</p>

<p>Men who scored the highest on the narcissism test were more likely to view women as conniving gold diggers, as teases who tempt men with sex and don't deliver, or as seductresses with plans to trick men and "get them under their thumb," Keiller said.</p>

<p>"Narcissistic men hold overtly hostile, adversarial ideas about women," Keiller said.</p>

<p>While narcissistic men also showed rancor toward gay men, their hostility toward them was no worse than that of other straight men.</p>

<p>About the only group that escaped narcissistic men's anger were lesbians, possibly because straight men tend to eroticize them, Keiller said.</p>
 

<p>Jean Twenge, a professor of psychology at San Diego State University and author of "The Narcissism Epidemic: Living in the Age of Entitlement," said the study fits with other research on narcissists.</p>

<p>"Narcissists don't have a problem with everyone, or with people that are different. They have a problem with people who may reject them," Twenge said. "They have a problem with heterosexual women, because those are the people who might see through them, reject them and not give them the attention and adulation they feel they deserve."</p>
<p>The findings suggest they view their relationships with women as patriarchal rather than egalitarian, the authors said.</p> 

<p>Men tend to have more narcissistic traits than women, possibly because girls, more than boys, are taught to be nurturing, selfless and to put others first, according to background information in the article. Likewise, men are more frequently diagnosed with narcissistic personality disorder than women.</p>

<p>Research suggests narcissistic men are also more likely to commit domestic violence because of their egocentrism and lack of empathy, although many men who commit violence are not narcissists, Keiller said.</p>

<p>Over time, narcissistic men do tend to get their comeuppance. Eventually, their anger and aggression turns off loved ones and employers, experts say.</p>
 
<p>"They can be charming, self-promoting and even in the face of evidence they are not great, they still think they're great," Twenge said. "But as they age, they are also more likely to fail at school, work and relationships.  It's tough to be a middle-aged narcissist." </p>

<p>Just ask actor Mel Gibson, who's made headlines recently with aggressive verbal outbursts directed at women. According to Keiller, it's impossible to know if he's a narcissist without a full exam, but his sexist comments toward a female police officer and his latest reported tirades toward ex-partner Oksana Grigorieva would seem to indicate he fits the bill.</p>

<HEADLINE><![CDATA[Ethicists Charge Doctor With Trying to Prevent Homosexuality in the Womb]]></HEADLINE>
<BLURB><![CDATA[But Dr. Maria New and supporters say she's helping children avoid a rare congenital disorder]]></BLURB>
<BYLINE><![CDATA[<b>By Dennis Thompson</b><br><i>HealthDay Reporter</i>]]></BYLINE>
<BODY><![CDATA[<p>FRIDAY, Aug. 6 (HealthDay News) -- Bioethicists are accusing a noted American pediatric endocrinologist and researcher of what they claim is the first attempt to prevent homosexuality and bisexuality in the womb in a dispute that has drawn in leading major medical organizations.</p>

<p>The accusations revolve around the experimental prenatal treatment of female fetuses for a condition called congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), which can result in girls being born with ambiguous genitalia.</p>

<p>The pediatrician, Dr. Maria New of the Mount Sinai School of Medicine and Florida International University, is a longtime champion of the prenatal use of a powerful steroidal medication called dexamethasone to prevent the development of CAH in the womb.</p>

<p>But some medical ethicists accuse New of having a hidden agenda. New has also taken part in research that has linked CAH to sexual orientation, noting that girls with CAH were more likely to be bisexual or homosexual and more likely to be interested in traditionally "masculine" careers and hobbies.</p>

<p>The bioethicists believe New's desire to treat female fetuses with dexamethasone stems from a desire to "prevent" lesbianism or bisexuality and steer girls toward classically defined femininity.</p>

<p>"Her main goal has been to prevent ambiguous genitalia and all the things that come with it, including what she calls 'behavioral masculinization,'" charged Alice Dreger, professor of clinical medical humanities and bioethics at Northwestern University's Feinberg School of Medicine. "She includes in that what she calls 'masculinized orientation.'"</p>

<p>Dreger described New's work as the first instance in the history of medicine that "clinicians are actively trying to prevent homosexuality."</p>

<p>Congenital adrenal hyperplasia remains a relatively rare condition, with about 1 in every 10,000 to 18,000 children born with the disorder, according to the U.S. National Institutes of Health. Girls and boys with CAH lack an enzyme needed by the adrenal gland to produce a pair of hormones, cortisol and aldosterone. The lack of these hormones prompts the body to produce more of the male sex hormone, androgen. This can cause girls to have genitals that look more male than female, even though their internal sex organs develop normally.</p>

<p>New declined to be interviewed for this article, but released a statement denying the charges.</p>

<p>"In my six years at Mount Sinai I have not administered the drug to any woman for the purpose of treating an unborn child," New's statement read. "Allegations that my goal is to prevent lesbianism are completely untrue." She added that she has received approval to conduct long-term evaluation of children who earlier received treatment with prenatal dexamethasone for CAH.</p>

<p>But Dreger said New's statement dodges the primary accusation that she and other ethicists have laid against the doctor: that New has recommended dexamethasone for use in treating CAH without notifying parents that the drug is not approved for that use.</p>

<p>"We're concerned that the women don't know the drug is experimental, or that they are part of an experiment," Dreger said. "All the major medical societies have said this is very experimental and should be done in clinical trials only, if at all."</p>

<p>Dreger noted that the Web site of the Maria New Children's Hormone Foundation attests that she "has treated over 600 pregnant women at risk for the birth of a CAH-affected child. Treatment begins as soon as pregnancy is confirmed." The Web site does not explain what treatment New used, only that she has been developing a treatment since 1984.</p>

<p>A number of major medical societies are drafting physician guidelines on the use of dexamethasone for CAH in a consensus paper prepared by the Endocrine Society and scheduled for publication in September in the <i>Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism</i>.</p>

<p>The guidelines will recommend that prenatal treatment of CAH continue to be regarded as an experimental procedure, noting that dexamethasone therapy can cause low birth weight and birth defects, such as cleft palate. The guidelines  will be endorsed by the American Academy of Pediatrics, the Lawson Wilkins Pediatric Endocrine Society, the European Society for Paediatric Endocrinology, the European Society of Endocrinology, the Society for Pediatric Urology, the Androgen Excess and PCOS Society, and the CARES Foundation.</p>

<p>The guidelines are <i>not</i> concerned with aspects of sexuality, according to Dr. Phyllis Speiser, who helped draft the document.</p>

<p>"Our main concern is long-term safety to the fetus. There are some trials that have been conducted in animal models that have some potential for long-term consequences," said Speiser, who is chief of pediatric endocrinology at Steven and Alexandra Cohen Children's Medical Center of New York and professor of pediatrics at New York University School of Medicine.</p>

<p>Besides an increased risk of cleft palate, those health concerns include a slight reduction in birth weight, she said.</p>

<p>"Our objective really is to be able to gather more information so we make sure that we can properly inform the families. Right now it's difficult to say what all the long-term safety concerns might be," Speiser said, adding that the controversy regarding homosexuality was not a factor in the drafting of the new guidelines.</p>

<p>"That's really not in the list of concerns that we have. That's not an objective of this therapy -- it never has been. I don't think that's really on the table here for consideration," Speiser said. "Unfortunately, doctors' intentions may have been misinterpreted."</p>

<p>But Dreger and her colleagues remain concerned that medical attempts to prevent homosexuality in utero will arise if researchers determine that sexual orientation is an innate quality of human biology.</p>

<p>Dreger worries that that knowledge could lead to prenatal interventions to direct humans toward heterosexual development. </p>

<p>"Evidence that homosexual orientation is inborn could, instead, very well lead to new means of [its] pathologization and prevention, as it seems to be in the case we've been tracking," she and co-writers Ellen K. Feder and Anne Tamar-Mattis wrote in a recent paper on New's research.</p>
