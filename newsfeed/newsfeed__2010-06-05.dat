<BODY><![CDATA[<p>FRIDAY, June 4 (HealthDay News) -- Only about one-third of American girls ages 13 to 17 have received the vaccine to protect against human papillomavirus (HPV), suggests a new study.</p>

<p>The vaccine, which targets four HPV strains strongly linked to cervical cancer, was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 2006. </p>

<p>The researchers analyzed HPV vaccination rates among more than 1,700 girls in Delaware, New York, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Texas and West Virginia. The data came from a national telephone survey called the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System.</p>

<p>"This was the first year the survey asked about HPV vaccination," study first author Sandi L. Pruitt, a postdoctoral research associate in the health behavior research division at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, said in a news release.</p>

<p>"That portion of the survey was optional, and only six states opted to use it. Ideally, we'd like to know what's happening in more states, but these six states represent a good cross-section of urban and rural, rich and poor, and they do include girls from racial and ethnic groups that closely mirror the rest of the country," Pruitt said.</p>

<p>There were no racial disparities in terms of vaccination.</p>

<p>"That's very important because the highest burden of cervical cancer is among women of color, especially Hispanic women and those who live along the U.S.-Mexico border," Pruitt said.</p>

<p>Girls of parents with higher levels of education were more likely to have received the HPV vaccine, known as Gardisil, but rates of vaccination declined as family income levels rose. That may be due to the rising number of wealthier parents who choose not to vaccinate their children for anything, Pruitt said.</p>

<p>The study is published in the May issue of the <i>Journal of Preventive Medicine</i>.</p>

<p>Of the estimated 11,000 women in the United States diagnosed with cervical cancer last year, about 4,000 will eventually die from the disease.</p>

<p>The American Cancer Society and the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommend that girls and young women get the three-dose vaccine.</p>

<BODY><![CDATA[<p>FRIDAY, June 4 (HealthDay News) -- Americans and Canadians infected with HIV are not getting diagnosed quickly enough after exposure, resulting in a potentially harmful delay in lifesaving treatment, a new large study suggests.</p>

<p>The observation stems from an analysis involving nearly 45,000 HIV-positive patients in both countries, which focused on a key yardstick for immune system strength -- CD4 cell counts -- at the time each patient first began treatment.</p>

<p>CD4 counts measure the number of "helper" T-cells that are HIV's preferred target.</p>

<p>Reviewing the participants' medical records between 1997 and 2007, the team found that throughout the 10-year study period, the average CD4 count at the time of first treatment was below the recommended level that scientists have long identified as the ideal starting point for medical care.</p>

<p>"The public health implications of our findings are clear," study author Dr. Richard Moore, from the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in Baltimore, said in a news release. "Delayed diagnosis reduces survival, and individuals enter into HIV care with lower CD4 counts than the guidelines for [initiating] antiretroviral therapy." A delay in getting treatment not only increases the chance that the disease will progress, but boosts the risk of transmission, he added.</p>

<p>Despite the fact that the average CD4 count at time of first presentation to care had risen over the course of the decade from 256 to 317, the researchers noted that even the high point was still below the treatment threshold of 350. Moore and his team also found that the average age at which patients had first sought care for HIV had risen over the ten-year period, from 40 to 43.</p>

<p>Writing in an editorial that accompanied the study, Dr. Cynthia Gay of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill expressed concern over the findings.</p>

<p>"These findings reveal that despite such compelling data, there is much room for improving our ability to link more HIV-infected individuals with effective treatment prior to immunological deterioration," she said in a news release.</p> 

<p>Moore and his colleagues report their findings in the June 1 issue of <i>Clinical Infectious Diseases</i>.</p>
