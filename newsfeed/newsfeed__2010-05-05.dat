<BODY><![CDATA[<p>WEDNESDAY, May 5 (HealthDay News) -- People who are resistant to HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, have a gene that gives them a stronger immune system, a new study shows.</p>

<p>A small number of people exposed to HIV -- about one in every 200 infected -- develop AIDS very slowly or never develop the disease. Previous research found that a large number of these naturally HIV-immune people have a gene called HLA B57.</p>

<p>In this new study, U.S. researchers found that HLA B57 causes the body to produce more powerful killer T cells, which are white blood cells that attack infectious invaders. People with HLA B57 have a larger number of T cells that bind strongly to more pieces of HIV protein than people who don't have the gene. In people with HLA B57, T cells are more likely to recognize cells that express HIV proteins, including mutated versions that arise during infection.</p>

<p>The findings may help scientists develop vaccines that trigger the same immune response to HIV that occurs naturally in people with HLA B57, according to the researchers from the Ragon Institute of Massachusetts General Hospital, MIT and Harvard.</p>

<p>The study was published online May 5 in the journal <i>Nature</i>.</p>

<HEADLINE><![CDATA[Inbreeding Possible Factor in Deaths of  Darwin's Children]]></HEADLINE>

<BODY><![CDATA[<p>WEDNESDAY, May 5 (HealthDay News) -- Charles Darwin's fears that inbreeding in his family would harm the health of his children were valid, says a new study.</p>

<p>In the study, researchers led by Tim Berra of Ohio State University, Mansfield, examined 25 families. They found a statistical association between child death and inbreeding in the Darwin/Wedgwood family line.</p>

<p>Darwin married his first cousin, Emma Wedgwood, and Darwin's mother was the daughter of third cousins. Three of Darwin's 10 children died before reaching adulthood, one from unknown causes as an infant and one from tuberculosis at age 10. Photographs suggest that another child who died from scarlet fever in infancy appeared to have developmental abnormalities.</p>

<p>The researchers -- who noted that inbreeding is an important risk factor in a number of diseases, including infectious diseases -- said the expression of harmful genes produced by inbreeding could explain the high number of deaths suffered by Darwin's children.</p>

<p>Inbreeding may also explain why three of Darwin's six children with long-term marriages had no children.</p>

<p>But the researchers also noted that three of Darwin's sons were fellows of the Royal Society and were knighted by Queen Victoria.</p>

<p>The study appears in the May issue of the journal <i>BioScience</i>.</p>
