<BODY><![CDATA[<p>THURSDAY, July 1 (HealthDay News) -- The number of children ages 12 months to 23 months immunized against hepatitis A increased in the United States, and rates of hepatitis A reached a record low after new vaccination recommendations were issued a few years ago, a new federal report says.</p>

<p>Hepatitis A is a contagious liver disease than can cause mild illness lasting for a few weeks or severe illness lasting several months.</p>

<p>In 2006, the federal Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommended routine hepatitis A vaccination for all children ages 12-23 months, regardless of risk category or location. The recommendation was issued after the minimum age for which the vaccine was licensed was lowered to 12 months from the previous minimum of 24 months.</p>

<p>In the new study, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention researchers analyzed data from eight Immunization Information System sentinel sites across the country and found that average hepatitis A vaccination coverage with one dose for children ages 12 to 23 months increased from 17 percent in 2006 to 47 percent in 2009. Average full vaccination coverage with two doses for children ages 12 to 23 months increased from 1 percent in 2006 to 15 percent in 2009.</p>

<p>The rate of increase for vaccination coverage was greatest in 2006 and the first quarter of 2007, but the rate of increase then slowed and coverage has plateaued, the researchers said.</p>

<p>The incidence of hepatitis A in the United States reached a historic low in 2007, the most recent year for which data are available.</p>

<p>While a single dose of hepatitis A vaccine is highly effective, a second dose should be given for long-term protection, the researchers noted.</p> 

<p>The researchers wrote that "immunization programs and vaccine providers should encourage children to receive hepatitis A vaccine, beginning at age 12 months. Reminder/recall notification and school or child-care entry vaccination requirements might contribute to increased vaccination coverage. Continued monitoring is needed to assess the trend in completion of the hepatitis A vaccine series among children."</p>

<p>The study appears in the July 2 issue of the CDC's <i>Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report</i>.</p>

<HEADLINE><![CDATA[Sex With Recent Smallpox Vaccine Recipient Can Lead to Illness]]></HEADLINE>

<BYLINE><![CDATA[<b>By Steven Reinberg</b><br><i>HealthDay Reporter</i>]]></BYLINE>
<BODY><![CDATA[<p>THURSDAY, July 1 (HealthDay News) -- After having sex with a soldier recently vaccinated against smallpox, a young woman in Washington state developed an illness caused by the vaccinia virus used in the shot, U.S. health officials report.</p>

<p>This type of viral transmission, while rare, is not unheard of, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p>

<p>"The patient visited an urgent care clinic with painful, ring-shaped vaginal swelling," explained  Andrea McCollum, an Epidemic Intelligence Service Officer with the CDC. "A few days before that, she had sexual contact with her boyfriend who was a recent smallpox vaccinee via the military."</p>  

<p>Although smallpox is now almost eradicated, U.S. military personnel have been vaccinated in recent years as a precaution against the potential use of the virus in a biological attack. The smallpox vaccine comes in the form of a live vaccine, so there is always some risk of infection, McCollum said. "The vaccine is <i>not</i> smallpox virus," she stressed, "but it's a closely related virus called vaccinia."</p>

<p>Although the woman told her doctor about her possible exposure to smallpox vaccine via sexual contact with her recently vaccinated boyfriend, the doctor tested her for common STDs but did not test for vaccinia, according to the report published in the July 1 issue of the CDC journal <i>Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report</i>.</p>

<p>Despite taking the antibiotics and antiviral medications that the doctor had prescribed, the woman continued having lesions and pain for the next three days, McCollum said.</p>

<p>A second doctor then sent her to an infectious disease specialist who confirmed that she had the vaccinia virus.</p>

<p>Vaccinia is relatively mild compared to smallpox, and the woman did not need any specific treatment. She did suffer some pain, soreness and irritation, which eventually resolved, McCollum said.</p>
 
<p>However, "we were quite concerned that she might transmit it to her household contacts," McCollum said, because one of her roommates had had a kidney transplant. The transplant patient was immunosuppressed and taking a lot of medication. "A vaccinia virus infection, particularly in an immunosuppressed individual, can be very serious and life-threatening," McCollum noted.</p>

<p>McCollum noted that there have been other cases of this infection transmitted from smallpox-vaccinated individuals to others. "At CDC, we don't know about every case of vaccinia that occurs," she said.</p>

<p>Including this case, the CDC is aware of five similar cases occurring over the past year, she said. "All the cases were women presenting with genital lesions that had had recent sexual contact exposure to military vaccinees."</p>

<p>In addition to military personnel, others who are vaccinated include some health care workers and laboratory personnel who work with the virus,  McCollum said.</p>
 
<p>In terms of immunizations generally, McCollum said the danger of transmitting a virus via a recent vaccination is present with vaccines that contain what's known as live virus. Most vaccines -- including most childhood and flu vaccines -- are made from the killed virus, and therefore pose no such danger, she said.</p>

<p>Infectious disease expert Dr. Marc Siegel, an associate professor of medicine at New York University in New York City, said that "smallpox vaccine being a live virus, there is a two-to-three-week period when you are still infectious from the vaccination site and you have to be very careful to cover it."</p>

<p>The oral polio vaccine is another live-attenuated vaccine, which has in very rare instances been associated with causing polio, Siegel noted.</p>

<p>However, the vast majority of vaccines utilize killed virus so this is not a problem with them, he  reiterated. "One exception is the inhaled flu vaccine. You could transmit influenza in a very weakened form to an immunocompromised person," he said. "But vaccinia is more infectious than that."</p>

<p>"This is a reminder that live virus vaccines, which are increasingly in disuse, carry their own risk of minor infection and should not be used in  immunocompromised people," Siegel said.</p>

<p>Live virus vaccines do have one advantage, in that they create a stronger immune response than do killed virus vaccines, Siegel added.</p>
