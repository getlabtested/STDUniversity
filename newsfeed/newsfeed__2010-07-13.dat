<HEADLINE><![CDATA[Word Games May Predict Life of Relationship]]></HEADLINE>

<BODY><![CDATA[<p>TUESDAY, July 13 (HealthDay News) -- Want to know if your romantic relationship will last "'til death do you part" -- or if you are cruising toward a breakup?</p>

<p>A simple word association game may reveal the hidden truth about your union, a new study suggests.</p>

<p>Most research on successful relationships is flawed because it relies on asking the people involved how they feel about each other, said researcher Dr. Ronald Rogge, an associate professor at the University of Rochester and co-author of a study recently published online in the journal <i>Psychological Science</i>.</p>

<p>That strategy assumes partners know how happy they are -- and tell the truth -- which is not always the case, he said.</p>

<p>Instead, Rogge and his colleagues used word association games that are often used to detect bias to see what people really think about their partners. </p>

<p>The researchers asked 222 volunteers who were involved in a romantic relationship to supply the partner's first name and two other words related to the partner, such as a pet name.</p>

<p>Next, the participants watched a monitor as three types of words were presented, one at a time, in the following three categories: good (for example, vacation or sharing); bad (such as, death or criticizing); and partner-related (names or traits). </p>

<p>In the first exercise, participants were told to press the space bar if a good word or partner word showed up. "What we were really interested to see is how easy it was to have partner words paired with a good target," Rogge said.</p>

<p>In another exercise, the participants were instructed to press the space bar if they saw a bad word or partner word. "If they were really good at that, that would suggest in the back of their mind they had a negative attitude toward the partner," Rogge said.</p>
<p>The median age of the couples in one exercise was 25; in the other, 23.</p>

<p>Rogge's team followed-up with the participants for one year and discovered that those who found it easy to associate their partner with bad words and difficult to associate their partner with good words were more likely to separate in the next year. The ones "who did well on the partner-bad tests and poorly on partner-good had a 75 percent risk of breakup," Rogge said.</p>

<p>"They had the least positive and most negative subconscious attitude," he said.</p>

<p>At the study's start, participants had also reported on the strength of their relationships. When Rogge compared the word association test results with the self-reports, he found the tests did a better job of predicting breakups.</p>

<p>How is that possible? He explained that the task kept the conscious mind busy as the researchers assessed the participants' subconscious thoughts. "It could either be something they don't know themselves or are not willing to tell you," he said.</p> 

<p>The game results could reveal the earliest signs of a relationship unraveling, possibly in time to save the partnership, the authors noted.</p>

<p>The new research is termed a "watershed" contribution by another expert, Dr. Eli Finkel, an associate professor of social psychology at Northwestern University, who has researched relationships.</p>

<p>The findings illustrate "the power of the unconscious to influence relationship outcomes," Finkel said. However, he added, "it's too early to know whether this unconscious measure will be useful for clinical or assessment purposes."</p>

<p>But Rogge said the strategy may eventually be used by therapists to assess relationship health and intervene if needed. Meanwhile, the test is available on his university Web site.</p>

<p>"You could do the test yourself and see where your attitudes lie," Rogge said.</p>
<p>"If you get feedback that says you don't have the strongest positive attitude and you are starting to get a subconscious negative attitude toward your partner, I would not immediately recommend breaking up," he said. "Use it as information. There is a lot people can do to make the relationship stronger."</p>

<p>TUESDAY, July 13 (HealthDay News) -- A couple-focused program cut risky sexual behaviors among black American couples in which one partner has HIV and the other is HIV-free, researchers report.</p>

<p>Researchers assigned 260 "serodiscordant" (differing in HIV status) black couples to a program that included eight weekly two-hour sessions that dealt with communication, problem-solving and other interpersonal factors associated with sexual risk reduction.</p>

<p>Another 275 serodiscordant black couples were assigned to a comparison group that took part in a program to increase fruit and vegetable consumption, physical activity and adherence to medical treatments, including HIV therapy.</p>

<p>At six and 12 months after the programs, the couples in the sexual risk-reduction program reported more consistent use of condoms than those in the comparison group (63 percent vs. 48 percent) and reported an average of 1.5 fewer acts of unprotected intercourse.</p>

<p>At the 12-month follow-up, there was no difference between the two groups in the cumulative incidence of sexually transmitted diseases, however. Of the partners who were HIV-free at the start of the study, two in the intervention group and three in the comparison group became HIV-positive during the study.</p>

<p>The study, published online July 12 in advance of print publication in the Sept. 27 issue of the <i>Archives of Internal Medicine</i>, will be presented at the upcoming International AIDS Conference in Vienna, Austria.</p>

<p>The rate of new HIV infections is about seven times higher among black Americans than among whites. Blacks made up about 12 percent of the U.S. population in 2006, but accounted for 45 percent of new HIV infections that year. Heterosexual exposure was the most common source of HIV infection among black women and the second most common source among black men.</p>

<p>"Public health scientists have urged a shift beyond individual-level HIV interventions to prevention strategies that have an impact on social structures and context to curb the epidemic among African Americans," wrote Nabila El-Bassel, of Columbia University School of Social Work, New York City, and colleagues.</p>

<p> "The intervention used here, in structure and content, was relationship based and redirected the focus to changing the relationship factors that influence sexual decision making and increasing the likelihood that risk reduction will be stable over time," she said.</p>
