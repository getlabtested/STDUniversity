<BODY><![CDATA[<p>THURSDAY, April 22 (HealthDay News) -- A strain of potentially lethal airborne fungus recently discovered in Oregon may soon spread to California and other neighboring areas, scientists warn.</p>

<p>Several people in Oregon have died after being infected with the new VGIIc genotype of <i>Cryptococcus gattii</i>. In the 21 Pacific Northwest cases analyzed by researchers, the strain has a death rate of about 25 percent.</p>

<p>"This novel fungus is worrisome because it appears to be a threat to otherwise healthy people. Typically, we see this fungal disease associated with transplant recipients and HIV-infected patients, but that is not what we are seeing," said Edmond Byrnes III, a graduate student in the Department of Molecular Genetics and Microbiology at Duke University Medical Center in North Carolina, in a news release.</p>

<p>Because this <i>C. gatti</i> strain is so dangerous, the researchers are calling for increased awareness and vigilance. Symptoms -- which can appear two to several months after exposure -- may include a cough that lasts weeks, sharp chest pain, shortness of breath, meningitis-related headache and weight loss. In animals, symptoms include a runny nose, breathing problems, nervous system problems and bumps under the skin.</p>

<p>The infection can be treated but there is no vaccine to prevent it.</p>

<p>The study appears online April 22 in the journal <i>PLoS Pathogens</i>.</p>
