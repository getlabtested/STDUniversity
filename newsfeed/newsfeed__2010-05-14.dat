<HEADLINE><![CDATA[A Woman's Touch Encourages Financial Risk-Taking]]></HEADLINE>
<BLURB><![CDATA[The same contact from a man had no effect, researchers found]]></BLURB>

<BODY><![CDATA[<p>FRIDAY, May 14 (HealthDay News) -- If you're about to make a big financial purchase, keep your distance from the friendly and helpful saleswoman.</p>

<p>A series of experiments by researchers from Columbia University and University of Alberta found both men and women were more likely to take financial risks after being lightly touched on the back by a woman, new research shows.</p>

<p>The same contact with a man did <i>not</i> result in more risk-taking.</p>

<p>Researchers say being touched by a woman may remind participants of their mother's touch during infancy, making them feel more secure and confident in taking chances.</p>

<p>"Certain forms of contact are associated with memories and emotional experiences of being touched by your mom," explained study author Jonathan Levav, an associate professor of business at Columbia University in New York City. "We wanted to find out how that played out among adults. What we found for financial risk-taking is a touch by a man doesn't have much influence, but a woman's touch does."</p>

<p>The study was recently published online in the journal <i>Psychological Science</i>.</p>
 
<p>In the first experiment, participants were ushered into a room with either a light, one-second touch on back of shoulder from a female, or simply asked to take a seat without any touching. Participants then had to answer 14 questions that involved decisions about money with varying levels of risk. For example, students were asked to choose between receiving $600 for sure, or flipping a coin and having a 50-50 chance of receiving $2,000.</p> 

<p>Both male and female participants who'd been touched were significantly more likely to gamble on the bigger payout.</p>

<p>In a second experiment, college business students were either touched by a male or a female, shook hands with a male or female, or were not touched. Students were then asked to choose between investing $5 (which represented $500) in some combination of riskier bank stocks or in safer bonds that delivered a 4 percent return.</p> 

<p>Those who'd been touched on the back by a woman put more of their money in stocks. Those who shook hands with a woman also showed a slight increase in their risk-taking. Neither shaking hands with or being touched by a man had any effect.</p>

<p>"People find even a woman's handshake slightly comforting," Levav said.</p>

<p>In the third experiment, participants were asked to write an essay about a time they felt "secure and supported" or "insecure and alone." Recalling these events "primed" participants to feel a certain way.</p>

<p>Researchers then repeated the touch vs. not touching situations prior to making investment choices.</p>

<p>Those who wrote about feeling insecure and were not touched were especially conservative in their investment choices. Those who wrote an essay about feeling insecure but were then touched by a woman were more likely to take financial risks -- about the same as those who started off feeling secure, according to the study.</p>

<p>Many previous studies have demonstrated that maternal contact is key to the development of children, Levav said, and that's true not just for human babies, but for many species, even spiders.</p>

<p>One study found that baby spiders who'd spent more time with their mothers were more likely to explore the far reaches of their maze, Levav noted.</p>

<p>"Maternal physical contact serves to promote attachment with the infant, which promotes feelings of security, which gives the infant inner strength to explore new uncertain things," Levav said.</p>
 
<p>The study also suggests that decisions that appear to be driven by rational processes can be influenced by more subjective, emotional and subconscious factors, Levav said. In his experiments, most participants could not remember having being touched.</p>

<p>The  experiments are "fascinating," said R. Chris Farley, an associate professor of psychology at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Though there are other possible explanations for why participants touched by a woman were more likely to takes risks -- perhaps some perceived the contact as romantic interest -- this is unlikely because both men and women responded similarly.</p>

<p>Further studies might look at whether or not people's relationships with their mothers or fathers might have any impact on how strongly people reacted to the touch, he added.</p>

<HEADLINE><![CDATA[Most Military Couples Satisfied With Their Relationships]]></HEADLINE>
<BLURB><![CDATA[Greater distress felt by soldiers whose families did not follow them to the base, study found]]></BLURB>

<BODY><![CDATA[<p>FRIDAY, May 14 (HealthDay News) -- The majority of married military couples currently in the service appear to be happy with the state of their relationships, a new study suggests.</p>

<p>The observation stems from a study conducted in 2008 by researchers at Kansas State University, who administered a quality-of-life survey to 700 U.S. Army soldiers stationed at Fort Riley, in Kansas, along with 390 of their spouses.</p>

<p>"Because of the stressors that have been on the military and military families, particularly in the last decade, it's easy to focus on the difficulty and dysfunction of their marriages," Jared Anderson, an assistant professor of family studies and human services at the university, said in a news release. "But I think one of the things that this study does is look at what makes these families resilient in the midst of ongoing stress."</p>

<p>The researchers found that although soldiers were 1.7 times more likely than their spouses to feel distress regarding their marriage, 81 percent of the soldiers and 85 percent of their spouses were "non-distressed" with respect to marital satisfaction.</p>

<p>The authors, whose research is still in the pre-publication stage, note that marital satisfaction bodes well for the long-term stability of military marriages, as well as for the individual well-being of soldiers and their families.</p>

<p>A healthy marriage report card, they note, could also have a positive impact on both soldier retention and readiness.</p>

<p>Nearly all the soldiers had been deployed at least once, while a third had been deployed twice or more. Although other research shows that combat exposure is a key factor in marital problems, deployment frequency alone was not associated with an increased likelihood to feel marital distress.</p>

<p>Instead, a greater likelihood of relationship distress among soldiers was linked to living on a U.S. base apart from one's family; being relatively newly married; having a lower rank; and dating or being engaged rather than married.</p>

<p>Noting that a snapshot of marital experience in just one Army post might not be representative of the national picture, the authors say they plan to expand their research in the future.</p>

<HEADLINE><![CDATA[Primary Care Docs Handling More HIV Cases]]></HEADLINE>
<BLURB><![CDATA[Over half of those surveyed have patients who have tested positive for the disease]]></BLURB>
<BYLINE><![CDATA[]]></BYLINE>
<BODY><![CDATA[<p>FRIDAY, May 14 (HealthDay News) -- A new U.S. survey, touted as the first of its kind, reveals that primary care doctors are taking over a larger share of care for people with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS.</p>

<p>Fifty-four percent of primary care doctors surveyed said they treat HIV-positive patients, and 43 percent said the number of HIV cases they treat had increased over the past year.</p>

<p>Among primary care physicians who treat HIV-positive patients, more than one-third said they see more than 200 cases a year.</p>

<p>"The state of HIV primary care is evolving rapidly, with serious implications for the health-care system," Brian Hujdich, executive director of HealthHIV, the organization that commissioned the report, said in a news release.</p>

<p>Hujdich called on more medical education for primary care doctors so they can provide better care.</p>

<p>HealthHIV, located in Washington, D.C., is a non-profit organization that provides education, technical assistance and health services research to organizations, communities and professionals to advance the care and support for people living with, or at risk for, HIV/AIDS.</p>

<p>The report, based on a national survey of 1,165 respondents, will be presented in July at the International AIDS Conference in Vienna.</p>
