<HEADLINE><![CDATA[FDA Panel Backs New 'Morning After' Pill]]></HEADLINE>
<BLURB><![CDATA[Marketed as ellaOne in Europe, it extends window of emergency contraception, but opponents see it as abortion drug]]></BLURB>
<BYLINE><![CDATA[<b>By Amanda Gardner</b><br><i>HealthDay Reporter</i>]]></BYLINE>
<BODY><![CDATA[<p>THURSDAY, June 17 (HealthDay News) -- A U.S. Food and Drug Administration advisory panel voted unanimously on  Thursday to recommend approval of a new emergency contraception pill that is effective for a longer period of time than the "morning after" pill known as Plan B.</p>

<p>The new drug, ulipristal acetate or UPA, is marketed under the brand name ellaOne and would be available only by prescription; it would be effective if taken up to five days after unprotected intercourse. Plan B, another emergency contraceptive, is only effective for up to three days after unprotected sex.</p>

<p>Although the FDA does not always follow the recommendations of its advisory panels, it typically does. </p>

<p>UPA, which is already marketed in 22 European countries, is made by French pharmaceutical company HRA Pharma.</p>

<p>The drug works by inhibiting ovulation, explained Dr. Paul Fine, medical director of Planned Parenthood of Houston &amp; Southeast Texas &amp; Louisiana and a professor of obstetrics, gynecology and urology at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston. </p>

<p>Fine was author of a study published earlier this year in <i>The Lancet</i> that found that UPA cut the risk of an unintended pregnancy in half as compared with levonorgestrel (also known as Plan B, which is now available over-the-counter) in women who took it within five days of unprotected sex.</p>

<p>The possibility of the FDA giving a green light to ellaOne has sparked intense debate as to whether the pill simply prevents pregnancy or actually induces an abortion.</p>

<p>"It is not an abortion pill," said Fine. "The reason for this is that if ovulation has already occurred and fertilization has occurred, then the pregnancy is going to happen. That is also true with Plan B." </p>

<p>"All we can hope is that the FDA advisory committee will listen to the science that's presented, and the science is very compelling that this is a very safe and very effective drug for emergency contraception," he added.</p>

<p>But anti-abortion advocates disagree.</p>

<p>According to Dr. Joe DeCook, a spokesman for the American Association of Pro-Life Obstetricians and Gynecologists (AAPLOG), at the doses recommended, ulipristal will not suppress ovulation but will, rather, "block the lining of the uterus from receiving progesterone, which makes it dysfunctional. It will not then support life."</p>

<p>"Life starts when the egg is fertilized. You have a complete genetic human being in a progressive growth stage just like you or me, just smaller than us and less developed," he added. "Ulipristal purposely causes the death of a complete human being, albeit very small and very early. We don't believe it is correct to purposely kill an innocent unborn child, no matter how small."</p>

<p>AAPLOG also has objections on safety grounds, the track record of studies conducted on the pill and, especially, the fact that there is a lack of data on the use of minors using the drug.</p>

<p>An FDA report issued earlier this week found UPA to be safe with no untoward side effects, reported <i>Agence France-Presse</i> (AFP). The FDA's review found the most common side effects to be nausea, headache, uterine pain, abdominal pain, fatigue and dizziness, <i>AFP</i> said. </p>

<p>Other more serious side effects did not seem to be due to the drug, the FDA stated. </p>

<p>At lower doses, UPA is being tested in late clinical trials as a treatment for uterine fibroids, according to Planned Parenthood. </p>

<HEADLINE><![CDATA[FDA Panel Votes Against Approval of  'Female Viagra']]></HEADLINE>
<BLURB><![CDATA[Little benefit seen in terms of increased libido, studies found]]></BLURB>
<BYLINE><![CDATA[]]></BYLINE>
<BODY><![CDATA[<p>FRIDAY, June 18 (HealthDay News) -- A U.S. Food and Drug Administration advisory panel on Friday unanimously agreed that a pill dubbed by some as a "female Viagra" did not show strong enough benefits to warrant approval.</p>

<p>Called flibanserin, the drug was aimed at premenopausal women with a diminished sex drive. It is related to the antidepressant family and affects serotonin and other chemicals in the brain. Drug maker Boehringer Ingelheim has been seeking FDA approval of the drug.</p>

<p>According to the <i>Associated Press</i>, the FDA advisers voted 11-0 that benefits linked to the pill did not outweigh side effects such as fainting spells, fatigue and depression.</p>

<p>While the agency isn't compelled to follow the recommendations of its advisory panels, it typically does so.</p>

<p>Earlier this week, the FDA released a review of two studies that found the drug didn't have much impact on a woman's libido but did seem to slightly boost sexual satisfaction, according to published reports.</p>

<p>The drug, with the proposed brand name Girosa, is designed to be taken in 100-milligram pills once a day at bedtime, according to the FDA.</p>

<p>Since the extraordinary success of Viagra for men, which hit the market a decade ago, pharmaceutical companies have repeatedly tried to find a comparable drug treatment for women. But none of those treatments has resulted in a significant benefit.</p>

<HEADLINE><![CDATA[On Father's Day, Give Dad Gift of Health]]></HEADLINE>
<BLURB><![CDATA[Staying healthy is part of being a good dad, expert suggests]]></BLURB>
<BYLINE><![CDATA[]]></BYLINE>
<BODY><![CDATA[<p>FRIDAY, June 18 (HealthDay News) -- This Father's Day, as dads unwrap their new ties and other tokens of gratitude, they might think about giving their families and themselves another kind of gift: a promise that they'll watch their health, suggests a family doctor at Loyola University Health System.</p>

<p>On average, men die younger than women and are more likely to die of heart disease, cancer, stroke and AIDS. But men are also much less likely than women to see their doctor, according to Dr. Aaron Michelfelder.</p>

<p>"Do your best to stay healthy. It's big part of being a good dad," he said in Loyola news release.</p>

<p>Men should visit their doctor at least once a year for a check-up and routine screenings, Michelfelder recommends.</p>

<p>"The earlier we diagnose such conditions as diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol and cancer, the more successfully we can treat them," he said.</p>

<p>Michelfelder also suggests regular screening tests for certain conditions:</p>
<ul><li>Body-mass index (BMI), a measure of body fat based on height and weight, should be checked yearly.</li>
<li>Men should start getting screened for colorectal cancer, beginning at age 50. Screening tests include colonoscopy, in which a doctor uses a tiny lighted tube to examine the colon (every 10 years), a fecal occult blood test (annually), and a fecal occult blood test with sigmoidoscopy (every five years).</li>
<li>A dental checkup at least once a year, but ideally every six months. Oral health problems can affect other areas of the body. Severe gum disease, for example, is associated with an increased risk of heart attack, stroke and heart disease.</li>
<li>A fasting blood test should be given to men with risk factors for diabetes such as a family history of the disease, being overweight, or symptoms of diabetes such as increased thirst and unusually frequent urination. The test measures the amount of glucose (sugar) in the blood.</li>
<li>Every male over age 18 should have his blood pressure checked at least once a year.</li>
<li>Men who report a hearing problem or work in a high-noise environment should have their hearing checked.</li>
<li>Cholesterol screening should be conducted on men aged 20 to 35 with cardiovascular risk factors such as diabetes. Men over age 35 should be screened once every five years if the results are normal, and more often if they have borderline levels.</li>
<li>Men aged 50 or older should get annual PSA tests and digital rectal exams.</li>
<li>Ultrasound screening for abdominal aortic aneurysm -- an unusual swelling in a blood vessel of the body's largest artery -- should be done on men aged 65 to 75 who have ever smoked. If detected before it ruptures and causes life-threatening bleeding, it can be repaired.</li></ul>

<p>Michelfelder also screens men for smoking, depression and alcohol abuse. He advises them to control their weight, get enough exercise and avoid risky sexual behavior.</p>
