<HEADLINE><![CDATA[Gay Teens Punished More Harshly Than Straight Peers: Analysis]]></HEADLINE>
<BLURB><![CDATA[Research points to double standard in schools, justice system]]></BLURB>

<BODY><![CDATA[<p>MONDAY, Dec. 6 (HealthDay News) -- Gay teens receive harsher punishments at school and in the court system than straight teens who engage in similar behavior, a new Yale University study suggests. </p>

<p>"Our analysis found that, consistently, gay and bisexual youth were at a greater risk of being punished by school and criminal-justice authorities than their straight peers who exhibited the same behaviors," said study leader Kathryn Himmelstein. </p>

<p>Girls, in particular, were singled out for harsher treatment, according to the study, published online Dec. 6 in <i>Pediatrics</i>.</p>

<p>Himmelstein and her colleague, Hannah Bruckner, wanted to know how sexual orientation predicted risk of punishment. Using an ongoing national survey that tracked adolescent health and behaviors, they analyzed the sexual orientation of more than 15,000 young people, relating that to various punishments and controlling for various factors, including race, gender, economic status and misbehavior.</p>

<p> The teens were questioned in 1994-1995 when they were in grades 7 through 12 and again in 2001-2002, when they were 18 to 26 years old. </p>

<p>In the 1994-1995 period, the participants were asked if they'd ever been expelled from school, stopped by the police, arrested before age 18,  or if they had pled guilty or been convicted in juvenile court. In the follow-up, they were asked about any arrests, guilty pleas or convictions as an adult. </p>

<p>Of the 15,170 study participants, 13 percent of males and 17 percent of females said they were attracted to someone of the same sex, while 5 percent of males and 6 percent of females said they'd had a same-sex romantic relationship, the study found. Fourteen percent of females and 6 percent of males defined themselves as other than 100-percent heterosexual. </p>

<p>Regardless of their sexual orientation, 76 percent of the participants said they'd committed minor offenses such as running away, shoplifting or getting drunk, the study  found. Thirty percent reported moderate wrongdoing such as selling drugs and burglary, and 41 percent said they'd engaged in violent behavior such as fighting, using a weapon or threatening someone with one. </p>

<p>However, nonheterosexual youth were 1.25 to three times more likely to be punished than  their heterosexual peers who engaged in the same level of misbehavior. "And youth who identified as gay, lesbian or bisexual actually engaged in less violence, which is the most serious type of misbehavior," said Himmelstein. </p>

<p>Their work may break new ground. "As far as I'm aware, this is the first nationally representative population-based study to document justice-related trends for gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgendered young people," said Stephen T. Russell, professor and director of the Frances McClelland Institute for Children, Youth and Families at the University of Arizona, Tucson. </p>

<p>Why schools and the courts come down harder on gay or bisexual youth wasn't clear from the study results, Himmelstein said. They may be intentionally or unintentionally punishing them for their sexual orientation, she added, or decision makers may be less likely to consider mitigating factors, such as self-defense, for a nonheterosexual adolescent than for a heterosexual peer.</p>
<p>Regardless of the cause, "steps need to be taken to address it," said Himmelstein. </p>

<p>Gay or bisexual youth often experience verbal or physical abuse by their peers and families, she noted, making them more likely to abuse drugs, carry a weapon for protection, and -- if they're homeless -- commit petty crimes to survive. "However, those who are harassed or engage in risky behaviors may find punishment instead of support, therapy or services," she said. </p>

<p>The findings suggest that professionals in the health, education, criminal justice and social service fields need to learn more about the challenges nonheterosexual youths face, perhaps with special training, said Himmelstein. Also, "institutions need to create, and then enact, policies that ensure that all youth are treated fairly and equally," she said. </p>

<p>Russell said the stigma, discrimination and prejudice that gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgendered young people experience may lead them to "act in ways that make them vulnerable to sanction."</p>

<p>"This is a really important study because it expands our understanding into justice, which is something we haven't noticed much about," he added.</p>

<HEADLINE><![CDATA[Teen Dating Violence is Common, Study Finds]]></HEADLINE>
<BLURB><![CDATA[It occurs in almost 1 in 5 couples, and perpetrators also often assault family, friends]]></BLURB>
<BYLINE><![CDATA[<b>By Randy Dotinga</b><br><i>HealthDay Reporter</i>]]></BYLINE>
<BODY><![CDATA[<p>MONDAY, Dec. 6 (HealthDay News) -- Almost one-fifth of high-school students admit they physically abused someone they were dating, and those same students were likely to have abused other students and their siblings, a new study finds.</p>

<p>The study provides new details about the links between various types of violence, said study lead author Emily F. Rothman, an associate professor at the Boston University School of Public Health.</p>

<p>"There's a huge overall connection between perpetration of dating violence and the perpetration of other forms of youth violence," she said. "The majority of students who were being violent with their dating partners were generally violent. They weren't selecting their dating partners specifically for violence."</p>

<p>For the study,  published in the December issue of the journal <i>Archives of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine</i>, the researchers surveyed 1,398 urban high school students at 22 schools in Boston in 2008 and asked if they had physically hurt a girlfriend or boyfriend, sibling or peer within the previous month.</p>

<p>The authors define physical abuse as "pushing, shoving, slapping, hitting, punching, kicking, or choking."  Playful aggression was excluded.</p>

<p>More than forty-one percent said they'd physically hurt another kid on at least one occasion the previous month; 31.2 percent reported that they'd physically abused their siblings, and nearly 19 percent said they'd abused their boyfriend, girlfriend, someone they were dating or someone they were simply having sex with.</p>
<p>Among those admitted to dating violence, 9.9 percent reported kicking, hitting, or choking a partner; 17.6 percent said they had shoved or slapped a partner, and 42.8 percent had cursed at or called him or her "fat," "ugly," "stupid" or a similar insult.</p>

<p>Proportionately more girls than boys (27 percent versus 10 percent) reported they'd abused dating partners.</p>

<p>After adjusting for factors including age and specific schools, the researchers found that abuse of dating partners was strongly linked to abuse of other students, especially among boys. </p>

<p>Students who used drugs, carried knives or had been in trouble with the law were also more likely to abuse their dating partners. And those who had witnessed community violence were also more likely to engage in violence.</p>
<p>These findings are consistent with research on adult male batterers, which has shown that domestic violence often accompanies other violent and criminal behavior, the authors said.</p>

<p>The study has some caveats, however. The students -- nearly 80 percent of whom were black or Hispanic -- only came from public high schools. Those who weren't recently dating were excluded, and the findings were self-reported. Also, motives were not examined, so it's unknown if any teens acted in self-defense.</p>

<p>Still, the results can help people who work with teenagers detect dating violence, Rothman said. "This study supports the idea that we should go to those kids who are being violent with siblings and peers and address their violent behavior in general," she said.</p>

<p>Monica Swahn, an associate professor at Georgia State University's Institute of Public Health whose research includes violence and injury epidemiology, said the study findings give researchers insight into how they may reduce teens' abusive behavior by targeting more than one type of violence.</p> 

<p>However, few anti-violence programs for school children have been shown to be effective, she said.</p>

<HEADLINE><![CDATA[Many Men Over 75 Still Sexually Active: Study]]></HEADLINE>
<BLURB><![CDATA[Almost a third in Australian report had been active in prior year]]></BLURB>
<BYLINE><![CDATA[<b>By Randy Dotinga</b><br><i>HealthDay Reporter</i>]]></BYLINE>
<BODY><![CDATA[<p>MONDAY, Dec. 6 (HealthDay News) -- Life for men aged 75 or older doesn't mean an end to sex, according to an Australian study.</p>

<p>The researchers found that almost a third of these older men were sexually active at least once a year -- including about 1 in 10 men aged 90 to 95.</p>

<p>What's more, many older men who are sexually active say they'd love to be having more sex.  Others are forgoing sex due to health issues, low testosterone levels or simply a lack of partners.</p>

<p>The study, based on a survey of Australian men aged 75-95, most of whom were married or living with a partner, found that younger seniors were busiest of all: 40 percent of those aged 75-79 said they'd had sex in the past 12 months. But even among those aged 90-95, 11 percent reported sexual activity with someone else over the prior year. </p>

<p>"Although many people, including some clinicians, continue to believe that sexual activity is not important to older people, our study shows this is not the case. Even in the 10th decade of life, 1 in 5 men still considered sex important," said study lead author Zoe Hyde, a researcher at the University of Western Australia.</p>

<p>The findings appear in the Dec. 7 issue of the <i>Annals of Internal Medicine</i>.</p>

<p>Several studies in recent years have tried to analyze sexuality in older people, who are sometimes assumed to have little or no interest in sex. The popularity of Viagra and related drugs seems to suggest that's hardly the case, but solid numbers have been tough to find.</p>

<p>However, one 2007 study in the <i>New England Journal of Medicine</i> reported that a bit more than half of people surveyed in the U.S. aged 65-74 reported recent sexual activity, as did 26 percent of those aged 74-85. </p>

<p>In the new study, researchers examined the results of a sexuality study of almost 2,800 Australian men who didn't live in nursing homes or other health-care facilities. Among other things, the researchers asked the men if they'd had sexual activity with a partner -- not necessarily intercourse -- within the past year. </p>

<p>Overall, close to 49 percent of men aged 75 to 95 considered sex at least "somewhat important," and just under 31 percent had been sexually active with another person at least once during the previous year.</p>

<p>The study linked a variety of factors to a lack of sexual activity among older men. "Increasing age, lower testosterone levels, a partner's lack of interest in sex, or physical limitations, osteoporosis, prostate cancer, diabetes, use of depression drugs, and use of some blood pressure drugs (beta-blockers) were associated with absence of sexual activity," the team wrote.</p>

<p>Overall, Hyde said, the study suggests that health problems are the main reason why some older men aren't sexually active. "But also lack of a partner and decreased interest in sex for some people are important factors, too," she said.</p>

<p>The researchers took special note of the connection between lower testosterone levels and less sexual activity. "However, it would be too early to suggest testosterone therapy to improve sexual interest and activity in older men at this stage," Hyde stressed. </p>

<p>As for older women, studies have suggested that pain and lack of satisfaction are major issues for them, said Dr. Stacy Tessler Lindau, an associate professor who studies sexuality at the University of Chicago. "If men are having sex, they report satisfaction. That's not necessarily true for women."</p>

<p>Lindau's 2007 study found that only 17 percent of women aged 75-85 reported having some sort of sex over the past year, compared to 39 percent of men.</p> 

<p>Were older men who were having sexual relations satisfied with how often it was happening? The new survey showed  slightly more than half (56.5 percent) of those who reported having some kind of sex within the previous year said they were happy with how much sex they were getting. But 43 percent of them said they had sex less often than they would like. </p>

<p>It's not clear if the findings are applicable to the United States, but Hyde said the results are similar to those from other Western countries. </p>

<p>Lindau, lead author of the 2007 <i>NEJM</i> study of seniors and sexuality, said this kind of research helps shine a light on a valuable and often-overlooked side of life for many older people. </p>

<p>"We know that sexual activity is associated with good physical and mental health. Whether good sex promotes good health or vice versa is still a good question," she said. "But if we fail to recognize older adults as having sexual lives, then we fail to engage them on the topic, reinforce positive sexual experiences or help them address sexual problems when they arise."</p>
