<p>TUESDAY, Aug. 10 (HealthDay News) -- In certain situations, competing for a mate may shorten a man's life.</p>

<p>U.S. researchers found that when men reach sexual maturity in settings where they far outnumber women, they live an average of three months less than males from areas with a more equitable gender ratio.</p>

<p>While previous studies have examined gender ratios and longevity in animals, this is the first time it's been studied in humans, according to senior author Nicholas Christakis, a professor of medicine and medical sociology at Harvard Medical School, and a professor of sociology at Harvard University's Faculty of Arts and Sciences.</p>

<p>"At first blush, a quarter of a year may not seem like much, but it is comparable to the effects of, say, taking a daily aspirin, or engaging in moderate exercise. A 65-year-old man is typically expected to live another 15.4 years. Removing three months from this block of time is significant," Christakis said in a Harvard news release.</p>

<p>For this study, he and his colleagues analyzed data from the long-term Wisconsin Longitudinal Study, which followed people who graduated from Wisconsin high schools in 1957. The researchers calculated the gender ratios of each high-school graduating class and then looked at the life spans of the graduates.</p>

<p>As of 2007, men from classes with more boys than girls didn't live as long as those from classes that had a more even gender balance. For 65-year-old men, the difference in lifespan was 1.6 percent.</p>

<p>The study appears in the August issue of the journal <i>Demography</i>.</p>

<p>While the researchers didn't look into the reasons for their finding -- or prove that it was related to the struggle to find a mate -- they believe a number of social and biological factors play a role. Trying to find a mate is stressful, and stress is a known contributor to health problems, Christakis noted.</p>

<HEADLINE><![CDATA[Transplant Patients Can Benefit From Loved Ones' Care]]></HEADLINE>

<BODY><![CDATA[<p>TUESDAY, Aug. 10 (HealthDay News) -- Transplant patients who have a close emotional connection with family members or other caregivers experience less depression and anxiety after surgery, new research has found.</p>

<p>The study included 74 liver transplant patients and their primary caregivers who were surveyed before surgery and six months after transplantation. Caregivers were asked to rate how close they felt to the patient, and the sample was divided into a group whose caregivers reported the most closeness and a group whose caregivers reported the least. </p>

<p>Symptoms of depression and anxiety decreased among the patients after their liver transplant, but the improvements weren't as significant for those with an emotionally distant caregiver, according to the researchers from the Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit.</p>

<p>"If you live with someone who loves you, the quality of care they provide may be much better, they may be more encouraging, you may want to please them and recuperate faster so you can spend quality time with them," lead author Anne Eshelman, of the Henry Ford Health System Behavioral Health Services, said in a hospital news release.</p>

<p>"Caregivers who are not close may provide the basic requirements, but don't help give someone a reason to live and look to the future," she added.</p>

<p>The study findings also indicated that emotional closeness was critical in male patients, but less so for women (although the researchers pointed out that interpretation of the results was difficult due to the small sample size).</p>

<p>"Men who had an adequate number of support people, but did not have close support, were still depressed and anxious at follow-up, compared to those who had closer support," Eshelman said. "Other literature shows that women have wider support, more friends and family they are connected to than men, and if the primary support person is not that close, they probably rely on the other people such as girlfriends."</p>

<p>The study was scheduled for presentation Aug. 6 at the International Congress of Behavioral Medicine in Washington, D.C.</p>
